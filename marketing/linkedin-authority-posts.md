## Post 1: "The Spreadsheet Graveyard"
**Best posting time**: Tuesday 7:30 AM AEST
---

It's 9:47 AM on audit day.

The NDIS auditor has just asked for the incident report from October. The one involving the after-hours call, the participant transfer, and the follow-up with the support coordinator.

Your compliance officer is scrolling through a shared Google Sheet. Row 387. No, row 412. Wait, someone renamed the tab. There are three versions of this file in the shared drive. One is called "Incidents FINAL v3 (use this one)."

The auditor is writing something down. That is not a good sign.

Here is the reality most providers will not talk about publicly: spreadsheets have no audit trail. No version history that an auditor will accept as evidence. No access controls. No chain of custody. No encryption. No automated alerts when a document expires or a deadline passes.

The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission does not accept "I think it's in a spreadsheet somewhere" as evidence of compliance. They require demonstrable systems. They require proof that the right person saw the right information at the right time, and that nobody altered it after the fact.

I built MySDAManager because I watched this exact scene play out. Not once. Repeatedly.

Every incident report, every complaint, every inspection, every consent form now lives in a system with immutable audit logs, role-based access, and a chain of custody that an auditor can verify in minutes, not hours.

Your spreadsheet is not a compliance system. It is a liability you have not been invoiced for yet.

If audit day makes your stomach turn, that is your system telling you something.

## Post 2: "The 2026 NDIS Audit Priority List"
**Best posting time**: Wednesday 8:00 AM AEST
---

The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission's 2026 enforcement priorities boil down to one word: Documentation.

Not intentions. Not verbal assurances. Documentation.

Here are five things every SDA provider should be able to produce within 15 minutes. Not 15 days. Fifteen minutes.

1. Current participant consent forms with recorded date, scope, and withdrawal options. APP 3 compliance is not optional. If your consent was verbal and undocumented, it does not exist.

2. Fire safety certificates for every property. FP1500s, essential services reports, emergency plans. Current. Not from 2024.

3. A documented complaints procedure with evidence of use. Not a policy sitting in a folder. Actual complaints received, acknowledged within 24 hours, resolved within 21 days, with a full chain of custody.

4. Incident reports with chain of custody. Who reported it, when, who was notified, what actions were taken, and proof that reportable incidents reached the Commission within 24 hours.

5. Property inspection records with photographic evidence. Dated, categorised, and tied to specific dwellings. Not a folder of unnamed photos on someone's phone.

If you cannot produce all five in 15 minutes, you have a gap. And gaps become findings. Findings become conditions on your registration. Conditions become restrictions on your ability to operate.

This is not about perfection. It is about having a system that makes compliance the default rather than the exception.

The providers who will thrive through the 2026 audit cycle are the ones building that system now, not the ones scrambling to build it the night before.

How many of the five can you produce right now?

## Post 3: "Why Self-Managing Your Compliance Docs Is High Risk"
**Best posting time**: Thursday 7:30 AM AEST
---

Self-managing your compliance docs sounds independent. Resourceful, even.

Until the auditor asks for chain of custody on that incident report from eight months ago.

"Who created this document?"
"When was it last modified?"
"Who accessed it between the incident date and today?"
"Can you prove it has not been altered?"

If your answer to any of those questions involves the phrase "I'd have to check," you have a problem. If your documents live in a shared drive, a Dropbox folder, or a USB stick in the office drawer, you have a bigger problem.

Here is what a shared folder cannot do:

It cannot prove who accessed a file and when. It cannot prevent someone from editing a record after the fact. It cannot encrypt sensitive participant data at rest. It cannot alert you when a certificate is about to expire. It cannot generate an audit trail that satisfies the NDIS Commission's evidentiary standards.

These are not nice-to-have features. They are the difference between a clean audit and a conditional registration finding.

MySDAManager was built specifically for this. Every document, every incident, every complaint lives in an Evidence Vault with AES-256 encryption, immutable audit logs with hash-chain integrity, and role-based access controls that track exactly who saw what and when.

When the auditor asks for chain of custody, the answer is not "I'd have to check." The answer is "Here. Every access logged. Every version preserved. Every timestamp verified."

Your compliance documentation is only as strong as the system that holds it.

## Post 4: "The $10,000 Spreadsheet"
**Best posting time**: Tuesday 12:00 PM AEST
---

What does it actually cost to track NDIS compliance manually?

Let us do the arithmetic.

Most SDA providers spend a minimum of four hours per week on compliance administration. Chasing expiring documents. Updating spreadsheets. Cross-referencing participant plans. Manually checking certificate dates. Compiling evidence packs before audits.

Four hours per week multiplied by 52 weeks multiplied by $48 per hour average loaded cost equals $9,984 per year.

Nearly ten thousand dollars. Just in labour. Just for one person.

That figure does not include the cost of a missed certificate expiry that triggers a non-compliance finding. It does not include the cost of audit remediation when your documentation falls short. It does not include the cost of conditional registration, which restricts your ability to take on new participants and new properties.

It does not include the cost of the staff member who burns out because compliance administration was never supposed to be their entire job.

MySDAManager starts at $250 per month. That is $3,000 per year.

For that, you get automated compliance alerts 90, 60, and 30 days before any expiry. Immutable audit trails. One-click audit evidence packs. Incident chain of custody. Consent lifecycle management. Real-time dashboards that show you exactly where your compliance gaps are before an auditor finds them.

$3,000 versus $10,000 in labour alone, plus the unquantified risk of non-compliance.

This is not a technology decision. It is a business decision. And the maths is not close.

Your compliance system should work harder than you do.

## Post 5: "Fire Safety Certificates: The Silent Registration Killer"
**Best posting time**: Monday 8:00 AM AEST
---

An expired FP1500 does not just fail an audit.

It puts residents at risk. And it puts your registration on the line.

Fire safety compliance is one of the NDIS Commission's non-negotiable items. There is no grace period. There is no "we're working on it." If a property does not have current fire safety certification, it is non-compliant. Full stop.

And yet, expired fire safety certificates remain one of the most common findings in SDA audits. Not because providers do not care. Because the system they use to track expiry dates failed them.

A calendar reminder is not a system. A sticky note on a monitor is not a system. A column in a spreadsheet that someone checks "when they get a chance" is not a system.

Here is what happens when a fire safety cert expires and nobody catches it. The auditor finds it. It becomes an immediate non-compliance finding. Your registration gets a condition attached. You have to prove remediation. The Commission may require additional audits at your cost. And if a resident was harmed during the gap in coverage, the consequences escalate dramatically.

All of that from a missed date.

MySDAManager has a Compliance Watchdog that tracks every certificate, every document, every expiry date across every property in your portfolio. It sends automated alerts at 90, 60, and 30 days before expiry. It escalates to critical status on the day of expiry. It cannot be ignored, snoozed, or accidentally deleted.

Your FP1500. Your essential services. Your building compliance. Your worker screening checks. All of it. Tracked. Monitored. Escalated.

Never miss an expiry again.

# Campaign Notes

## Posting Cadence
- **Frequency**: 2 posts per week for 2.5 weeks (5 posts total in the first cycle)
- **Schedule**: Tuesday/Wednesday or Monday/Thursday pairings to avoid weekend drop-off
- **Recycle**: After the initial cycle, repurpose each post as a carousel or short video script for a second pass
- **Gap week**: After the 5-post cycle, take one week off from promotional content and post a genuine industry observation or commentary to maintain credibility

## Recommended Posting Order
1. Week 1 Tuesday: Post 1 (The Spreadsheet Graveyard) -- emotional hook, sets the tone
2. Week 1 Thursday: Post 2 (2026 Audit Priority List) -- value-first, shareable checklist
3. Week 2 Tuesday: Post 4 (The $10,000 Spreadsheet) -- financial argument, different angle
4. Week 2 Thursday: Post 3 (Self-Managing Compliance Docs) -- technical credibility
5. Week 3 Monday: Post 5 (Fire Safety Certificates) -- urgency closer

## Engagement Strategy
- **First 30 minutes**: After posting, immediately engage with any comments. LinkedIn's algorithm heavily weights early engagement velocity
- **Seeding**: Before posting, engage with 5-10 posts from people in your target audience (SDA providers, NDIS compliance professionals) so your name is already visible in their feed
- **Comment replies**: Never reply with a link. Always reply with substance first, then mention the tool naturally if relevant
- **Tag sparingly**: Only tag people who have explicitly agreed to be tagged or who you have a genuine relationship with. Cold-tagging looks desperate
- **Repost with commentary**: When someone shares your post, repost their share with a genuine thank-you and an additional insight. This creates a feedback loop
- **DM follow-up**: When someone comments with a pain point (e.g., "This is exactly our problem"), wait 2-4 hours, then send a short DM: "Saw your comment. Happy to show you how we solved this if you're interested. No pitch, just a 15-min walkthrough."

## Content Repurposing
- Each post can become a 60-second talking-head video for LinkedIn native video
- Posts 2 and 4 work well as LinkedIn carousels (one point per slide)
- Post 1 works as a short narrative video with b-roll of someone scrolling a spreadsheet
- All 5 posts can be adapted into blog articles with expanded detail for SEO on mysdamanager.com/blog

# Direct Outreach Template

## Target: NDIS Registered Auditors and SDA Assessors

**Subject context**: This message is for LinkedIn direct outreach to NDIS auditors, SDA assessors, and quality and safeguards consultants. Personalise the first line for each recipient.

---

Hi [First Name],

I noticed your work in [NDIS auditing / SDA assessment / quality and safeguards consulting] and wanted to reach out directly.

I have built a compliance and property management platform specifically for SDA providers called MySDAManager. The reason I am contacting you is not to sell you software. It is because I think it makes your job significantly easier.

Here is the short version: when SDA providers use MySDAManager, they walk into audits with their documentation already in order. Incident chain of custody, consent lifecycle, fire safety cert tracking, complaints procedure evidence, inspection records with photos -- all of it accessible in minutes, not hours.

The audit trail is immutable with hash-chain integrity. Every access is logged. Every document version is preserved. The system generates a one-click audit evidence pack covering all seven standard compliance sections.

I have heard from providers that audit preparation used to take weeks. With this system, it takes an afternoon.

I would genuinely value your perspective on it. Would you be open to a 15-minute demo? No pitch deck, no slides. Just the product. I want to know if this is something you would feel confident recommending to providers you work with.

Either way, I appreciate your time.

# 5-Part Welcome Email Sequence

## Email 1: Welcome -- Your Audit Trail Starts Now
**Trigger**: Immediate (on account creation)
**Subject**: Your audit trail starts now
**Preheader**: Every action from this point forward is logged, timestamped, and tamper-proof.

---

Hi [First Name],

Welcome to MySDAManager.

Here is what just happened behind the scenes: your account creation was logged with a timestamp, your organisation was provisioned with its own isolated data environment, and your audit trail officially started.

That is not a marketing statement. It is how the system works. Every action you take from this point forward -- every document you upload, every incident you record, every inspection you complete -- is logged with an immutable, hash-chained audit entry that cannot be altered or deleted.

This matters because when the NDIS Commission asks "can you demonstrate your systems and processes," you will not be scrambling. You will be showing them a live audit trail.

Here are three things to do in your first 10 minutes:

1. **Add your first property.** Go to Properties and enter your first SDA dwelling. The system will prompt you for the details that matter for compliance: design category, building type, fire safety cert dates.

2. **Upload a document.** Any compliance document -- a fire safety certificate, an SDA registration, a worker screening check. The system will automatically track its expiry date and alert you before it lapses.

3. **Explore the dashboard.** Your compliance status is visible at a glance. Green means current. Yellow means expiring soon. Red means action required.

If you need help at any point, every major page has a built-in SOP guide (look for the help icon). These are not generic FAQs. They are step-by-step procedures aligned with NDIS Practice Standards.

Your compliance system is live. Start using it.

## Email 2: 3 Things Auditors Check First
**Trigger**: Day 2
**Subject**: The first 3 things an NDIS auditor asks for
**Preheader**: If you can produce these in under 5 minutes, you are ahead of 90% of providers.

---

Hi [First Name],

When an NDIS auditor walks in, they do not start with a random question. They start with the items most likely to reveal systemic issues.

Here are the first three things they typically ask for:

**1. Your complaints register and procedure.**

Not your policy document. Your actual register. They want to see complaints received, when they were acknowledged, how they were investigated, and how they were resolved. They want to see the chain of custody -- who handled each step.

In MySDAManager, every complaint is tracked with a reference number, automatic acknowledgment deadlines, resolution tracking, and a full chain of custody log. You can pull the entire register as a PDF in one click.

**2. Incident reports with notification evidence.**

Reportable incidents must be notified to the Commission within 24 hours. The auditor will check whether you met that deadline and whether your documentation supports it.

MySDAManager timestamps every incident from creation through notification. The system flags reportable incidents and tracks the 24-hour countdown. The chain of custody shows exactly who was notified and when.

**3. Current participant consent records.**

APP 3 requires documented, informed consent with clear scope and withdrawal options. Verbal consent is not sufficient.

MySDAManager manages the full consent lifecycle: initial recording, annual renewal reminders, and withdrawal processing. It generates compliant consent forms including Easy Read versions.

Take 10 minutes today to check whether you can produce all three of these from your current system. If you cannot, start building the evidence in MySDAManager now, before audit day.

## Email 3: How the Evidence Vault Works
**Trigger**: Day 4
**Subject**: How the Evidence Vault protects your compliance data
**Preheader**: AES-256 encryption. Immutable audit logs. Chain of custody on every record.

---

Hi [First Name],

By now you have had a few days to explore MySDAManager. Today I want to explain the infrastructure underneath the surface, because this is what separates a compliance system from a shared folder with a password.

**Encryption at rest.**

Every sensitive field in MySDAManager -- NDIS numbers, dates of birth, emergency contacts, bank details -- is encrypted with AES-256-GCM. This is the same encryption standard used by financial institutions. If someone gained access to the raw database, the data would be unreadable without the encryption keys.

**Immutable audit logs.**

Every action in the system -- every create, update, delete, view -- is recorded in an audit log that cannot be modified or deleted. Each log entry is linked to the previous entry using SHA-256 hash chaining. If anyone attempted to alter a historical record, the hash chain would break, and the system would flag the integrity violation.

This is not theoretical. The system runs a daily integrity verification check at 3 AM UTC.

**Chain of custody.**

For incidents, complaints, and inspections, the system maintains a complete chain of custody. Every person who touched the record, every status change, every notification sent -- all timestamped and attributed.

When an auditor asks "can you prove this incident report has not been modified since it was created," the answer is not "we think so." The answer is "here is the hash chain. Verify it yourself."

**What this means for you.**

You do not need to think about any of this during your daily work. The system handles it automatically. But when audit day comes, this infrastructure is the difference between "we follow best practice" and "here is the cryptographic proof."

If you have not uploaded your key compliance documents yet, now is a good time. Every document you add is immediately protected by this infrastructure.

## Email 4: Set Up Your First Compliance Watchdog Alert
**Trigger**: Day 7
**Subject**: Set up your first Compliance Watchdog alert (2 minutes)
**Preheader**: Automated expiry tracking for every certificate, document, and plan in your portfolio.

---

Hi [First Name],

One week in. Here is a quick task that will save you hours of manual tracking.

**Set up your first Compliance Watchdog alert.**

The Compliance Watchdog monitors every document and certificate in your system for upcoming expiries. It sends automated alerts at 90, 60, and 30 days before expiry, and escalates to critical status on the day.

Here is how to activate it:

**Step 1.** Go to any property in your portfolio and open its details.

**Step 2.** Check that your key compliance documents are uploaded with expiry dates:
- Fire safety certificate (FP1500)
- Essential services report
- SDA registration certificate
- Building compliance certificate
- Worker screening checks

**Step 3.** That is it. There is no Step 3. The Watchdog activates automatically for every document with an expiry date.

You will see the status on your dashboard immediately. Green for current. Yellow for expiring within 30 days. Red for expired.

**Why this matters.**

An expired fire safety certificate is an immediate non-compliance finding. An expired worker screening check is a reportable event. An expired SDA registration means you cannot claim SDA funding for that property.

None of these are the kind of thing you want to discover on audit day.

The Compliance Watchdog ensures you discover them 90 days in advance, when you still have time to act.

If you manage multiple properties, repeat this for each one. The dashboard will give you a portfolio-wide view of every upcoming expiry.

Two minutes of setup. Months of peace of mind.

## Email 5: Your Trial Ends Soon -- Here Is What You Will Lose
**Trigger**: Day 12
**Subject**: Your trial ends in 2 days
**Preheader**: Your audit trail, your alerts, your evidence -- here is what happens next.

---

Hi [First Name],

Your MySDAManager trial ends in 2 days. I want to be straightforward about what that means.

**What you keep either way.**

Any data you have entered during your trial is yours. If you decide not to continue, you can export your data before your trial expires. We do not hold your information hostage.

**What you lose if you do not continue.**

Your Compliance Watchdog alerts stop. If a fire safety certificate or worker screening check is approaching expiry, nobody will be notified. The countdown continues silently.

Your audit trail freezes. New actions will not be logged. The chain of custody on active incidents and complaints will have a gap -- and auditors notice gaps.

Your automated consent renewal reminders stop. If a participant's consent is approaching its 12-month renewal, you will need to track that manually.

Your one-click audit evidence pack becomes unavailable. When audit day comes, you will be back to compiling evidence manually from spreadsheets, shared drives, and email threads.

**What continuing costs.**

The Starter plan is $250 per month. That is less than the loaded cost of a single hour of audit remediation work. It is less than the cost of one missed expiry that triggers a non-compliance finding.

**If you are ready to continue:**

Go to Settings in your MySDAManager dashboard and select your plan. Setup takes less than two minutes. Your data, your audit trail, and your Watchdog alerts continue without interruption.

**If you are not sure:**

Reply to this email. I will personally walk you through the system and answer any questions. No sales team. No scripts. Just a direct conversation about whether this solves your problem.

Your compliance does not pause when your trial does.
