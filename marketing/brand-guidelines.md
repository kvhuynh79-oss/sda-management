# Section 1 -- Brand Foundation

## 1.1 Brand Purpose

MySDAManager exists because no SDA provider should lose their NDIS registration over a missed document.

The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission does not distinguish between providers who do the wrong thing and providers who cannot prove they did the right thing. The outcome is the same: conditions on registration, restrictions on operations, and loss of the ability to house the Australians who need specialist disability accommodation most.

Every tool on the market today was built for something else and adapted sideways. Rostering tools. Billing tools. Generic property management software. SDA providers are forced to juggle three to five separate systems, none of which understand the SDA regulatory environment, and none of which talk to each other.

MySDAManager is the first and only platform built from the ground up for SDA property management and NDIS compliance. It exists to close the gap between good practice and provable practice.

## 1.2 Brand Vision

**No SDA provider loses registration because of a missed document.**

This is the future we are building toward. A future where every fire safety certificate is tracked automatically. Where every incident has a timestamped chain of custody. Where every consent form has a renewal alert. Where audit preparation takes an afternoon, not a fortnight. Where the question "can you prove it?" is always answered with "here -- verify it yourself."

We will know we have succeeded when an NDIS auditor walks into any SDA provider in Australia and every piece of evidence they ask for is produced in minutes.

## 1.3 Brand Mission

Give every Australian SDA provider the tools to protect their registration, serve participants with confidence, and grow without drowning in compliance paperwork.

We do this by replacing scattered spreadsheets, shared drives, filing cabinets, and email inboxes with a single compliance operating system where properties, participants, maintenance, incidents, inspections, documents, and payments live together -- tracked, timestamped, and audit-ready from the moment data enters the system.

## 1.4 Brand Promise

**Audit-ready from day one.**

This is not a marketing slogan. It is a technical commitment. From the moment a provider creates their MySDAManager account, every action is logged in an immutable audit trail with SHA-256 hash chain integrity. Every document is tracked with expiry dates and renewal alerts. Every incident has a chain of custody. Every inspection has photographic evidence. The system does not require weeks of setup or data migration to deliver compliance value. The audit trail starts on day one.

## 1.5 Core Values

### Value 1: Compliance-First

Every product decision begins with one question: does this help a provider prove compliance? Features that do not serve compliance do not ship. We do not build tools for convenience and then add compliance as an afterthought. Compliance is the architecture, not the paint.

**Behavioural manifestation**: When we design a new feature, the first line of the specification describes what audit evidence it produces. When we write marketing copy, we lead with the compliance outcome, not the feature name. When we prioritise the roadmap, compliance gaps take precedence over nice-to-have functionality.

### Value 2: Radical Transparency

We tell providers exactly what our platform does and does not do. We do not claim to guarantee NDIS compliance -- no software can guarantee regulatory outcomes. We do not use vague language like "streamline your workflow" when we mean "generate a 7-section audit evidence pack in one click." We show our pricing publicly. We explain our security architecture in plain language. We do not hide behind sales calls.

**Behavioural manifestation**: Our pricing page shows exact prices with no "contact us for a quote." Our security documentation explains AES-256 encryption, hash chain integrity, and RBAC in terms any provider can understand. Our marketing copy uses specific numbers, timeframes, and outcomes instead of adjectives.

### Value 3: Built for Australia

MySDAManager is not a global SaaS product adapted for the Australian market. It was born inside a real Australian SDA management business. Every feature exists because an Australian provider needed it -- not because a developer in another country imagined it. We use Australian English, Australian dates, Australian currency, and Australian privacy law as our defaults, not as options buried in settings.

**Behavioural manifestation**: We spell "organise" not "organize." We format dates as DD/MM/YYYY. We reference specific NDIS Practice Standards, APP 3, and the SDA Design Standard by name. We understand FP1500s, SIL agreements, and the difference between Improved Liveability and High Physical Support. We do not explain what NDIS stands for to our audience.

### Value 4: Participant Dignity

The people living in SDA properties are not "clients," "consumers," or "tenants." They are participants in the NDIS. Our language reflects this consistently. Our platform handles their personal information -- NDIS numbers, dates of birth, emergency contacts, health data -- with the highest level of protection: field-level AES-256 encryption, role-based access controls, and consent lifecycle management that respects their right to withdraw consent at any time.

**Behavioural manifestation**: We use the word "participant" in every context. We never use stock photography of people with disabilities without explicit consent and appropriate representation. We build consent management as a first-class feature, not a checkbox. Our Easy Read consent forms are 12 pages with illustrations because informed consent requires genuine effort.

### Value 5: Relentless Reliability

SDA compliance does not take weekends off. A fire safety certificate does not stop expiring because the office is closed. An incident notification deadline does not pause because someone is on leave. MySDAManager must be available, accurate, and trustworthy at all times. We run daily integrity verification checks on our audit logs at 3 AM UTC. We send expiry alerts at 90, 60, and 30 days. We maintain immutable records that cannot be altered or deleted, even by administrators.

**Behavioural manifestation**: We test our alert systems obsessively. We never mark a feature as complete until it handles edge cases (What if the user is offline? What if the certificate has no expiry date? What if consent is withdrawn mid-renewal?). We build offline capability for incident reporting because connectivity is not guaranteed in regional Australia.

## 1.6 Brand Positioning

### Positioning Statement (Geoffrey Moore Format)

**For** Australian SDA providers who manage 5 to 50 properties,
**who** struggle to prove compliance across scattered spreadsheets, shared drives, and generic NDIS tools,
**MySDAManager is** the compliance-first property management platform
**that** keeps your registration safe
**because** it was built exclusively for the SDA regulatory environment --
**unlike** ShiftCare, Brevity, CTARS, and GoodHuman, which focus on service delivery and rostering, not property management and compliance evidence.

### Category Ownership

MySDAManager owns the category: **SDA Property Management Software.**

This category did not exist before us. Every competitor in the adjacent space -- ShiftCare, Brevity, CTARS, GoodHuman, Lumary, SupportAbility -- occupies a different category: NDIS service delivery software, rostering, billing, or client management. None of them are property management platforms. None of them track dwellings, fire safety certificates, building compliance, inspections, or owner payments.

We do not compete with these tools. We sit alongside them. An SDA provider uses ShiftCare for rostering AND MySDAManager for property compliance. They are not substitutes. They are complements.

This positioning is critical. We never position MySDAManager as "better than ShiftCare." We position it as "the tool ShiftCare does not replace."

### Market Context

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| SDA market size (annual) | $592M |
| Enrolled SDA dwellings | 11,360 |
| Annual market growth | 20%+ |
| Registered SDA providers | ~500 |
| Target segment | Providers managing 5-50 properties |
| Direct competitors | Zero (category creator) |
| Adjacent competitors | ShiftCare, Brevity, CTARS, GoodHuman, Lumary |

### Brand Pillars

Five pillars support every MySDAManager communication. Every piece of content should reinforce at least one.

1. **Compliance evidence, not compliance hope.** We produce the proof, not the promise.
2. **One system, not five workarounds.** Properties, participants, compliance, payments, and maintenance in one place.
3. **Built by a provider, for providers.** Born inside a real SDA management business.
4. **Australian-first, always.** NDIS-native language, dates, currency, and regulatory references.
5. **Security as infrastructure.** AES-256, hash chains, RBAC, and MFA are the foundation, not add-ons.

# Section 2 -- Messaging Framework

## 2.1 Primary Tagline

> **Audit-ready from day one.**

This tagline communicates confidence, not fear. It tells the provider that the moment they start using MySDAManager, their compliance posture improves. There is no "six-month implementation." There is no "we will get there eventually." The audit trail starts immediately.

Usage: Website hero, email signatures, social media bios, sales decks, print materials.

## 2.2 Secondary Taglines

For specific campaigns and contexts, use these approved variations:

| Context | Tagline |
|---|---|
| Fear/urgency campaigns | "The NDIS crackdown is here. Are you ready?" |
| Workaround campaigns | "Still juggling spreadsheets, emails, and generic NDIS tools?" |
| Category ownership | "The compliance operating system built for SDA providers." |
| Simplicity | "One platform. Every property. Every participant. Every deadline." |
| Security | "Your participants' data deserves bank-grade security." |
| ROI | "Stop paying $10,000/year for compliance labour that software handles in minutes." |
| Builder credibility | "Built by an SDA provider, for SDA providers." |

## 2.3 Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)

"MySDAManager is Australia's only compliance-first property management platform built specifically for SDA providers. It replaces the spreadsheets, shared drives, and generic NDIS tools that most providers juggle today with a single system where properties, participants, compliance documents, maintenance, inspections, incidents, and payments all live together -- tracked, timestamped, and audit-ready from day one. When the Commission calls, you produce the evidence in minutes, not weeks."

## 2.4 Boilerplate (100 Words)

MySDAManager is Australia's first purpose-built SDA property management and compliance platform. Designed by a registered SDA provider for SDA providers managing 5 to 50 properties, MySDAManager replaces scattered spreadsheets and generic NDIS tools with a single compliance operating system. The platform combines property management, participant records, maintenance tracking, incident reporting, inspection checklists, document management with automated expiry alerts, and NDIS payment processing -- all protected by AES-256 encryption, immutable audit logs, and role-based access controls. MySDAManager generates complete 7-section NDIS audit evidence packs in one click, reducing audit preparation from weeks to minutes. Learn more at mysdamanager.com.

## 2.7 Objection Handling Scripts

These are the six most common objections heard in sales conversations. Each includes the objection, the reframe, and the response.

### Objection 1: "We can't afford it."

**Reframe**: You cannot afford NOT to have it. Manual compliance costs more.

**Response**: "The average SDA provider spends at least $10,000 per year on manual compliance administration -- that is four hours a week at $48/hour loaded cost, just chasing documents, updating spreadsheets, and preparing for audits. MySDAManager Starter is $3,000 per year. You save $7,000 in labour alone, before counting the cost of a single missed expiry that triggers an audit finding. This is not an expense. It is a $7,000 annual return on a compliance insurance policy."

**Data point**: 4 hours/week x 52 weeks x $48/hour = $9,984/year vs $3,000/year for MySDAManager Starter.

### Objection 2: "Our spreadsheets work fine."

**Reframe**: They work until they do not. And you will not know they failed until audit day.

**Response**: "Can you produce a complete audit evidence pack -- incident chain of custody, current consent records, fire safety certificates, complaints register, and inspection history -- in 15 minutes? Because that is what the Commission expects. A spreadsheet has no audit trail an auditor will accept, no access controls, no encryption, no automated alerts, and no chain of custody. It is not a compliance system. It is a liability you have not been invoiced for yet."

### Objection 3: "We're too small to need software."

**Reframe**: Small providers are more vulnerable, not less.

**Response**: "The NDIS Commission does not adjust its compliance requirements based on how many properties you manage. A provider with 5 properties has the same documentation obligations as one with 50. The difference is that a large provider can absorb the cost of an audit finding. For a small provider, a conditional registration can be existential. MySDAManager Starter is designed for providers with up to 10 properties and 5 users, specifically because we know smaller operators need compliance protection the most."

### Objection 4: "Is our data safe?"

**Reframe**: Safer than it is right now.

**Response**: "Every sensitive field -- NDIS numbers, dates of birth, emergency contacts, bank details -- is encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM, the same encryption standard used by financial institutions. All data is hosted on Australian servers under Australian privacy law. Access is controlled by role-based permissions with MFA for administrator accounts. The audit log is immutable with SHA-256 hash chain integrity, verified daily at 3 AM UTC. Compare that to your current system: a shared Google Drive with a password that three former employees probably still have."

### Objection 5: "Switching is too hard."

**Reframe**: It is not a migration. It is a 15-minute setup.

**Response**: "MySDAManager is not replacing your entire IT infrastructure. You add your first property in five minutes. Upload your first document in two minutes. The Compliance Watchdog activates automatically for every document with an expiry date. There is no six-month implementation, no consultant engagement, no data migration project. Start with one property, see the value, then expand. Your existing spreadsheets stay where they are until you are ready to move everything over."

### Objection 6: "We already use ShiftCare / Brevity / CTARS."

**Reframe**: Those are rostering and billing tools. We are a property management tool. They are not the same thing.

**Response**: "ShiftCare manages your roster. Brevity bills your services. CTARS tracks client interactions. None of them track properties, fire safety certificates, building compliance, inspections, owner payments, or SDA-specific compliance evidence. You do not replace ShiftCare with MySDAManager. You use them together. ShiftCare handles who is working where. MySDAManager handles whether the property they are working in has current fire safety certification, whether the participant's consent is current, and whether the last inspection found any defects that need follow-up."

## 2.8 Competitor One-Liners

Use these in sales conversations, social media, and comparison pages. Never name competitors in marketing materials unprompted -- only use these when a prospect raises a specific tool.

| Competitor | One-Liner |
|---|---|
| ShiftCare | "ShiftCare manages your roster. We manage your compliance." |
| Brevity | "Brevity bills your services. We protect your registration." |
| CTARS | "CTARS tracks clients. We track properties, clients, AND evidence." |
| GoodHuman | "GoodHuman focuses on service delivery. We focus on the property underneath." |
| Lumary | "Lumary is a CRM for NDIS services. We are a compliance system for SDA properties." |
| Spreadsheets | "Your spreadsheet cannot alert you 30 days before a fire safety cert expires." |
| Shared drives | "A shared folder cannot prove who accessed a file and when. We can." |
| Paper filing | "A filing cabinet is not an audit trail. It is a liability." |

# Section 3 -- Visual Identity

## 3.1 Colour System

MySDAManager uses a dark-first colour system. The dark theme is the primary brand expression. Light mode exists as a secondary accommodation but is not the default identity.

### Primary Brand Palette

| Role | Colour Name | Hex | RGB | Tailwind Class | CSS Variable | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary | Teal-600 | #0d9488 | 13, 148, 136 | `teal-600` | `--brand-primary` | Buttons, links, accents, focus rings, brand elements |
| Primary Hover | Teal-700 | #0f766e | 15, 118, 110 | `teal-700` | `--brand-primary-hover` | Button hover states, active elements, pressed states |
| Primary Light | Teal-500 | #14b8a6 | 20, 184, 166 | `teal-500` | `--brand-primary-light` | Feature headlines on dark backgrounds, highlighted text |
| Primary Bright | Teal-400 | #2dd4bf | 45, 212, 191 | `teal-400` | `--brand-primary-bright` | Hover text, link hover states, decorative accents |
| Primary Subtle | Teal-900/40 | #0d9488 at 40% opacity | -- | `teal-900/40` | -- | Highlight sections, selected states, tinted backgrounds |

### Dark Theme Palette (Primary Brand Expression)

| Role | Colour Name | Hex | RGB | Tailwind Class | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Page Background | Gray-900 | #111827 | 17, 24, 39 | `bg-gray-900` | All page backgrounds, canvas |
| Card / Surface | Gray-800 | #1f2937 | 31, 41, 55 | `bg-gray-800` | Cards, panels, modals, header, footer strips |
| Input / Inner Surface | Gray-700 | #374151 | 55, 65, 81 | `bg-gray-700` | Form inputs, inner panels, table headers, borders |
| Border | Gray-700 | #374151 | 55, 65, 81 | `border-gray-700` | Card borders, dividers, separators |
| Subtle Border | Gray-600 | #4b5563 | 75, 85, 99 | `border-gray-600` | Input borders, secondary dividers |

### Text Palette

| Role | Colour Name | Hex | RGB | Tailwind Class | Usage | WCAG on Gray-900 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary Text | White | #ffffff | 255, 255, 255 | `text-white` | Headlines, primary body text, buttons | AAA (21:1) |
| Secondary Text | Gray-300 | #d1d5db | 209, 213, 219 | `text-gray-300` | Body text, descriptions | AAA (11.7:1) |
| Muted Text | Gray-400 | #9ca3af | 156, 163, 175 | `text-gray-400` | Captions, labels, supporting text, placeholders | AA (7.0:1) |
| Disabled Text | Gray-500 | #6b7280 | 107, 114, 128 | `text-gray-500` | LIGHT BACKGROUNDS ONLY. Fails WCAG on dark bg. | FAIL on dark (4.6:1) |

**CRITICAL ACCESSIBILITY RULE**: Never use `text-gray-500` (#6b7280) or `text-gray-600` (#4b5563) on dark backgrounds (Gray-900, Gray-800). These fail WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text). Always use `text-gray-400` (#9ca3af) as the minimum text colour on dark backgrounds.

### Semantic Colours

| Role | Colour Name | Hex | Tailwind Class | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Success | Green-500 | #22c55e | `green-500` | Compliant states, active statuses, success messages |
| Success Text | Green-400 | #4ade80 | `green-400` | Success text on dark backgrounds |
| Warning | Yellow-500 | #eab308 | `yellow-500` | Expiring soon, caution states |
| Warning Text | Yellow-400 | #facc15 | `yellow-400` | Warning text on dark backgrounds |
| Danger | Red-500 | #ef4444 | `red-500` | Expired, non-compliant, errors, critical alerts |
| Danger Text | Red-400 | #f87171 | `red-400` | Error text on dark backgrounds |
| Info | Teal-600 | #0d9488 | `teal-600` | Informational states, in-progress |
| Info Text | Teal-500 | #14b8a6 | `teal-500` | Info text on dark backgrounds |
| Neutral | Gray-500 | #6b7280 | `gray-500` | Inactive, archived, disabled |

### Status Badge Pattern

All status badges follow a consistent pattern: 20% opacity background with the corresponding 400-weight text colour.

```
bg-{colour}-500/20 text-{colour}-400
```

Examples:
- Active: `bg-green-500/20 text-green-400`
- Warning: `bg-yellow-500/20 text-yellow-400`
- Error: `bg-red-500/20 text-red-400`
- Info: `bg-teal-600/20 text-teal-500`
- Neutral: `bg-gray-500/20 text-gray-400`

### Colour Usage Rules

1. **Teal is the anchor.** Every page, every screen, every social media tile must include at least one teal element. Teal says "this is MySDAManager."
2. **Never use blue as an accent.** Blue (#3b82f6) was the previous brand colour. It has been fully replaced by teal. Using blue creates brand confusion.
3. **Red is for compliance failures only.** Do not use red for decorative purposes. Red means something is wrong, expired, or requires immediate attention.
4. **Green is for compliant states only.** Do not use green decoratively. Green means a certificate is current, a status is active, or an action succeeded.
5. **Maintain dark backgrounds on all social media.** Gray-900 (#111827) is the canvas for every social media asset. Light backgrounds break brand recognition.

## 3.2 Typography

### Primary Typeface: Geist Sans

Geist Sans is the sole typeface for all MySDAManager digital touchpoints: the application, website, social media assets, PDFs, and email templates.

**Font family declaration**:
```css
font-family: var(--font-geist-sans), -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
```

**Fallback stack**: If Geist Sans is unavailable (email clients, third-party platforms), the system falls back to the operating system's default sans-serif font. Do not substitute with Helvetica, Arial, or any other specific fallback. The system font stack provides the closest visual match.

### Typography Scale

| Level | Element | Tailwind Class | Size | Weight | Line Height | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Display | Marketing hero | `text-5xl` or `text-6xl` | 48-60px | Bold (700) | 1.1 | Landing page hero headlines only |
| H1 | Page title | `text-4xl` | 36px | Bold (700) | 1.2 | One per page. Main page heading. |
| H2 | Section heading | `text-2xl` | 24px | Bold (700) | 1.3 | Section divisions within a page |
| H3 | Subsection heading | `text-lg` | 18px | Semi-Bold (600) | 1.4 | Card titles, subsection labels |
| H4 | Minor heading | `text-base` | 16px | Semi-Bold (600) | 1.5 | Form group labels, minor divisions |
| Body | Default text | `text-sm` or `text-base` | 14-16px | Regular (400) | 1.5 | Body copy, descriptions, form values |
| Caption | Supporting text | `text-xs` | 12px | Regular (400) | 1.4 | Timestamps, metadata, helper text |
| Button | Interactive label | `text-sm` | 14px | Medium (500) | 1.0 | All button labels |
| Badge | Status label | `text-xs` | 12px | Medium (500) | 1.0 | Status badges, tags, pills |

### Typography Rules

1. **One h1 per page.** Every page has exactly one `<h1>`. It is the page title. Nothing else.
2. **Heading hierarchy.** Never skip heading levels. After h1 comes h2, then h3. Never go from h1 to h3.
3. **Bold for emphasis, not CAPS.** Use font-weight 600 or 700 for emphasis. Never use ALL CAPS in body text. ALL CAPS is reserved for badge labels and section markers (e.g., "COMPLIANCE TIP").
4. **Maximum two weights per visual.** On social media tiles and marketing graphics, use no more than two font weights (e.g., Bold + Regular, or Semi-Bold + Regular). Three or more weights create visual noise.
5. **No decorative fonts.** Geist Sans is the only permitted font. Do not introduce secondary display fonts, script fonts, or serif fonts for marketing purposes.

### Social Media Typography Scale

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hero headline | 52-56px | Bold (700) | 1.1 |
| Slide headline | 40-48px | Bold (700) | 1.2 |
| Body headline | 28-36px | Semi-Bold (600) | 1.3 |
| Body text | 18-22px | Regular (400) | 1.5 |
| Caption / label | 12-16px | Regular (400) | 1.4 |
| Metadata | 12-14px | Regular (400) | 1.3 |

## 3.3 Logo System

### Logo Variants

MySDAManager uses three logo variants. All variants use the "MySDAManager" wordmark.

**Variant 1: Primary (Dark Background)**
- White logotype on transparent background
- For use on Gray-900, Gray-800, and any background darker than Gray-700 (#374151)
- File: `mysda-logo-dark.svg`
- This is the default logo for 90%+ of applications

**Variant 2: Light Background**
- Dark logotype (Gray-900 or teal-700) on transparent background
- For use on white or light backgrounds (business cards, letterheads, light-mode contexts)
- File: `mysda-logo-light.svg`
- Use sparingly -- dark backgrounds are the primary brand expression

**Variant 3: Monochrome**
- Single-colour logotype (white or black) on transparent background
- For use in contexts where colour reproduction is limited: fax, photocopies, embossing, engraving
- File: `mysda-logo-mono-white.svg`, `mysda-logo-mono-black.svg`

### Logo Usage Rules

**Minimum size**: 100px wide for digital, 25mm wide for print.

**Clear space**: Maintain a clear zone around the logo equal to the height of the "M" in "MySDA" on all sides. No text, icons, images, or other elements may encroach on this space.

**Background requirements**:
- Always place the primary (white) logo on backgrounds darker than #374151 (Gray-700)
- Always place the light logo on backgrounds lighter than #d1d5db (Gray-300)
- Never place any logo on a busy background, photograph, or gradient that reduces legibility

**Placement defaults**:
- Social media tiles: Bottom-left of the brand footer strip
- LinkedIn banner: Left side, vertically centred in the safe zone
- Email signatures: Left-aligned, 120px wide
- Application header: Top-left, alongside the organisation's white-label logo
- PDF documents: Top-right, sized proportionally to the page header

### Prohibited Logo Modifications

1. Do not rotate, skew, stretch, or distort the logo
2. Do not add drop shadows, glows, outlines, or bevels
3. Do not change the logo colours (except approved monochrome variants)
4. Do not place the logo inside a coloured box, circle, or shape
5. Do not recreate the logo in a different font
6. Do not animate the logo
7. Do not add a blue background rectangle behind the logo (this was specific to one organisation's branding and is not part of the MySDAManager identity)
8. Do not use the logo at sizes smaller than the minimum (100px digital, 25mm print)

## 3.4 Icon Style

MySDAManager uses **Heroicons** (outline style) as the standard icon set across all digital touchpoints.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Icon set | Heroicons (heroicons.com) |
| Style | Outline (not solid, not mini) |
| Stroke width | 1.5px |
| Default size | `w-5 h-5` (20x20px) for inline icons, `w-6 h-6` (24x24px) for navigation |
| Colour | Inherits from parent text colour (typically `text-gray-400` or `text-white`) |
| Interactive colour | Teal-500 (#14b8a6) on hover or active state |

### Icon Rules

1. **Never use emoji as icons.** All emoji icons have been replaced with Heroicon SVGs across the codebase. Do not reintroduce emoji.
2. **Maintain consistent sizing.** Within a single interface region (sidebar, toolbar, card header), all icons must be the same size.
3. **Use outline style only.** Solid icons are reserved for selected/active states in navigation. All other contexts use outline.
4. **Icon + label, not icon alone.** Every icon-only button must have an `aria-label` for accessibility. Prefer icon + text label where space permits.

## 3.5 Photography and Illustration Guidelines

### Photography

MySDAManager does not use generic stock photography. When photography is required, follow these principles:

1. **Australian context.** Properties, landscapes, and settings should be recognisably Australian.
2. **Dark tech aesthetic.** Photography should complement the dark UI. Prefer images with dark backgrounds, low-key lighting, or dark overlays.
3. **No stock smiles.** Do not use generic stock photos of people smiling at computers, shaking hands, or pointing at whiteboards.
4. **Disability representation.** Never use stock photography of people with disabilities without explicit consent and appropriate representation. If disability imagery is required, commission it with participants who have given informed consent.
5. **Property photography.** When showing SDA properties, use real photographs (with permission) or architectural renders. Do not use generic apartment photos.

### Illustration

MySDAManager uses a minimal illustration style:

1. **Line illustrations only.** Consistent with the Heroicon outline style. Simple line drawings with 1.5-2px stroke weight.
2. **Teal accent colour.** Illustrations use Gray-400 (#9ca3af) as the primary stroke colour with Teal-500 (#14b8a6) as the accent colour.
3. **No clipart.** No cartoon characters, no comic-style illustrations, no 3D renders.
4. **Functional illustrations.** Illustrations should explain a concept (e.g., data flow diagram, feature overview) rather than decorate.

### Dark Theme as Primary

The dark theme (Gray-900 background) is the primary brand expression for MySDAManager. All external-facing materials -- social media, marketing website, sales decks, promotional PDFs -- should use the dark theme.

Light mode exists as an accessibility accommodation within the application. It is not a brand choice. Marketing materials, social media posts, and brand assets should never use light/white backgrounds unless physically required (e.g., printed letterhead, newspaper advertisement).

## 3.6 Component Patterns

These are the core UI patterns that define MySDAManager's visual language. Agencies and designers should reference these when creating marketing materials that show the product interface.

### Cards

```
Background:   bg-gray-800 (#1f2937)
Border:       border border-gray-700 (#374151)

```

### Focus States

```
All interactive elements: focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-teal-600
Outline offset: 2px

```

## 3.7 Spacing System

MySDAManager uses a 4px grid with the following scale:

| Token | Value | Pixels | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `space-1` | 0.25rem | 4px | Tight gaps: icon-to-text, badge padding |
| `space-2` | 0.5rem | 8px | Small gaps: between related elements |
| `space-3` | 0.75rem | 12px | Compact sections |
| `space-4` | 1rem | 16px | Standard element spacing |
| `space-5` | 1.25rem | 20px | Form group spacing |
| `space-6` | 1.5rem | 24px | Card padding, section gaps |
| `space-8` | 2rem | 32px | Major section divisions |
| `space-10` | 2.5rem | 40px | Page section padding |
| `space-12` | 3rem | 48px | Hero section padding |
| `space-16` | 4rem | 64px | Major page divisions |

### Spacing Rules

1. **Label to input**: `mb-1` (4px). All form labels sit 4px above their input.
2. **Page header margin**: `mb-8` (32px). All page headers have 32px bottom margin before content.
3. **Card padding**: `p-6` (24px) standard, `p-4` (16px) for compact cards.
4. **Grid gaps**: `gap-4` (16px) for standard grids, `gap-6` (24px) for dashboard grids.

## 3.8 Responsive Design

| Breakpoint | Tailwind Prefix | Pixels | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Default (mobile) | None | 0-639px | Single column, stacked layout |
| Small | `sm:` | 640px+ | Two-column forms begin |
| Medium | `md:` | 768px+ | Desktop navigation appears, bottom nav hides |
| Large | `lg:` | 1024px+ | Full desktop layout, sidebars appear |
| Extra Large | `xl:` | 1280px+ | Maximum content width, wider tables |

### Responsive Rules

1. **Always mobile-first.** Never use bare `grid-cols-2` or `grid-cols-3`. Always start with `grid-cols-1` and add responsive variants: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`.
2. **Touch targets.** All interactive elements must be at least 44x44px on mobile (WCAG 2.5.8).
3. **Bottom navigation.** On mobile (`md:hidden`), key pages display a fixed bottom navigation bar with 56px touch targets.
4. **Safe areas.** All fixed-position elements respect `safe-area-inset-bottom` for notched devices.

# Section 4 -- Voice and Tone

## 4.1 Voice Attributes

MySDAManager's voice is consistent across all channels. It does not change based on the platform. What changes is the tone (see 4.2).

### Attribute 1: Knowledgeable, Not Academic

We know the SDA regulatory environment inside out. We reference FP1500 fire safety certificates, APP 3 consent requirements, 24-hour incident notification windows, and SDA Design Standards by name because our audience knows them by name. We do not explain what NDIS stands for. We do not provide primers on disability housing policy. We speak as peers who share the same regulatory reality.

**Do**: "Your FP1500s, essential services reports, and building compliance certificates all have different expiry dates. The Compliance Watchdog tracks every one of them."

**Do not**: "Fire safety is an important aspect of property management in the disability sector. Regulations require that certain certificates are kept up to date."

### Attribute 2: Protective, Not Fearful

We protect providers from compliance risk. We do not terrorise them with worst-case scenarios that have no resolution. Every warning we issue comes with a solution. Every risk we identify comes with a tool to mitigate it. Fear without action is manipulation. Fear with a clear path forward is service.

**Do**: "An expired fire safety certificate is an immediate non-compliance finding. The Compliance Watchdog alerts you 90 days before expiry so you never face that situation."

**Do not**: "If your fire safety certificate expires, you could lose your registration, be forced to close your properties, and face legal action from the Commission."

### Attribute 3: Direct, Not Blunt

We say what we mean in as few words as possible. We do not pad our copy with qualifiers, hedges, or corporate language. But we are never rude, dismissive, or condescending. Direct means respectful efficiency with language.

**Do**: "Generate a complete audit evidence pack in one click."

**Do not**: "Our innovative platform solution empowers providers to leverage streamlined workflows for comprehensive audit documentation generation."

Also do not: "Just click the button. It is not that hard."

### Attribute 4: Australian, Not Parochial

We are proudly Australian. We use Australian English, Australian references, and Australian regulatory frameworks. But we do not wrap ourselves in flags or lean on nationalism. "Australian" means we understand the specific context our users operate in -- NDIS, SDA, NDIA, Australian Privacy Principles -- not that we think Australia is better than anywhere else.

**Do**: "Built for the NDIS regulatory environment, with Australian English, DD/MM/YYYY dates, and AUD currency as defaults."

**Do not**: "Australia's greatest compliance platform, built with true-blue Aussie values."

### Attribute 5: Peer, Not Vendor

We speak as fellow SDA operators, not as a software company selling a product. Our founder built this platform because they needed it themselves. We have been through NDIS audits. We have chased fire safety certificates. We have compiled evidence packs manually. We know what it feels like. This shared experience is the foundation of every conversation.

**Do**: "I built MySDAManager because I watched providers lose registrations over documentation gaps -- not bad practice, just scattered evidence."

**Do not**: "Our cutting-edge SaaS solution provides best-in-class compliance management for the disability accommodation vertical."

## 4.2 Tone by Context

The voice stays the same. The tone adapts to the situation.

### Marketing Copy

**Tone**: Confident, urgent (but not alarmist), evidence-based.

The marketing tone creates a sense of urgency around compliance risk while immediately offering the resolution. Every piece of marketing copy follows the pattern: pain point, consequence, solution. Never leave the reader in the pain without showing the path forward.

**Example**: "The NDIS Commission does not care how hard you work. They care what you can prove. MySDAManager makes proving it automatic."

### Onboarding

**Tone**: Warm, encouraging, practical.

The onboarding tone welcomes new providers and guides them through setup with clear, actionable steps. No jargon. No assumptions about technical skill. Celebrate progress without being patronising.

**Example**: "Your audit trail officially started the moment you created this account. Here are three things to do in your first 10 minutes."

### Support

**Tone**: Empathetic, action-oriented, patient.

The support tone acknowledges the user's frustration or confusion and immediately provides a clear next step. Never blame the user. Never say "as per our documentation." Always provide a direct answer first, then context if needed.

**Example**: "The document you uploaded did not include an expiry date, which is why it is not appearing in the Compliance Watchdog. You can add the expiry date by opening the document details and updating the Expiry Date field."

### Legal and Compliance Documentation

**Tone**: Precise, transparent, structured.

The legal tone is factual and unambiguous. Sentences are short. Terms are defined on first use. Obligations are stated plainly. No marketing language. No hedging. No "may" when we mean "will."

**Example**: "MySDAManager encrypts all participant NDIS numbers, dates of birth, and emergency contacts at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption. Encryption keys are stored separately from encrypted data."

### Error Messages

**Tone**: Calm, solution-focused, specific.

Error messages tell the user what happened, why it happened, and what to do next. Never use technical error codes as the primary message. Never use "oops," "something went wrong," or "please try again later" without explaining what "it" is.

**Example**: "The session expired because you were inactive for more than 15 minutes. Enter your PIN to resume, or log in again to start a new session."

### Compliance Alerts

**Tone**: Clear, time-sensitive, actionable.

Compliance alerts communicate urgency with specificity. They include what is expiring, when it expires, and what the user should do. Never use vague language like "action required."

**Example**: "FP1500 fire safety certificate for 42 Oak Street expires in 28 days (14/03/2026). Upload the renewed certificate to resolve this alert."

## 4.3 Writing Rules

### Sentence Structure

1. **Active voice always.** "The system generates the report" not "The report is generated by the system."
2. **Maximum 25 words per sentence** in marketing copy. Longer sentences are permitted in technical documentation and legal text.
3. **Maximum 3 sentences per paragraph** in marketing copy. Blog posts and documentation may use longer paragraphs.
4. **Lead with the outcome.** "Generate a complete audit pack in one click" not "By clicking the generate button, a complete audit pack is produced."
5. **One idea per sentence.** If a sentence contains "and" twice, split it.

### Australian English

All public-facing content uses Australian English.

| Rule | Example |
|---|---|
| -ise spelling | organise, standardise, customise, optimise |
| -our spelling | colour, labour, behaviour, favour |
| Date format | DD/MM/YYYY (14/02/2026) |
| Time format | 12-hour with am/pm (9:30 am, 2:15 pm) |
| Currency | AUD with dollar sign ($250/month) |
| Per cent | "per cent" in formal documents, "%" in social and product copy |

**Exception**: Code, internal documentation, and variable names use US English for consistency with the JavaScript/TypeScript codebase (e.g., `color`, `organization`). This is never visible to users.

### Numbers

1. **Spell out one through nine** in body copy. Use numerals for 10 and above.
2. **Always use numerals** for: prices ($250), dates (14/02/2026), times (9:30 am), percentages (73%), measurements (25mm), and statistics (11,360 dwellings).
3. **Use commas as thousands separators**: 11,360 not 11360.
4. **Use "to" not hyphens for ranges**: "5 to 50 properties" not "5-50 properties" in body copy. Hyphens are acceptable in tables and headings.

### Punctuation

1. **En-dashes (--) not em-dashes or hyphens** for parenthetical statements in social copy and marketing.
2. **Oxford comma**: Yes. Always. "Properties, participants, and compliance" not "Properties, participants and compliance."
3. **Full stops in headings**: No. Headings do not end with full stops. Questions end with question marks.
4. **Exclamation marks**: Never in product copy. Rarely in marketing (maximum one per piece). Never in legal or support text.

# Section 5 -- Content Templates

## 5.1 LinkedIn Post Template

LinkedIn is the primary social channel for MySDAManager. Every post follows this structure:

```
[HOOK -- 1-2 lines that stop the scroll. State a provocative truth,
ask a pointed question, or open with a surprising fact. Never start
with "I'm excited to announce..." or "We're thrilled to share..."]

[BODY -- 3-5 short paragraphs. Each paragraph is 1-3 sentences.
Use line breaks between paragraphs for readability. Lead with the
pain point, then transition to the insight or solution.]

[PROOF POINT -- Include a specific number, timeframe, or example.
"73% of audit findings relate to documentation gaps." Not "many
providers struggle with documentation."]

[CTA -- One clear call to action. Link to mysdamanager.com or a
specific page. Never include more than one link.]

[HASHTAGS -- 8-12 hashtags. Mix broad (#NDIS, #SDA) with niche
(#NDISCompliance, #SDAProvider, #AuditReady). Always on a new line.]
```

### Hook Formulas

1. **Provocative truth**: "SDA management is not a rent collection business. It is an evidence collection business."
2. **Uncomfortable question**: "Can you produce a complete audit evidence pack in 15 minutes? Because that is what the Commission expects."
3. **Surprising statistic**: "73% of NDIS audit findings relate to documentation gaps. Not bad practice. Documentation."
4. **Audit day scenario**: "It is 9:47 AM on audit day. The NDIS auditor has just asked for the incident report from October."
5. **Cost calculation**: "That spreadsheet tracking your SDA compliance costs $10,000 per year. Not because of what it costs. Because of what it misses."

### Hashtag Library

**Primary (use on every post)**:
```
#NDIS #SDA #NDISCompliance #SDAProvider #DisabilityHousing
```

**Secondary (rotate 3-5 per post)**:
```
#NDISAudit #AuditReady #NDISProvider #SILProvider #PropertyManagement
#DisabilityAccommodation #PropTech #NDISCommission #SDAManagement
#SpecialistDisabilityAccommodation #NDISQuality
```

**Campaign-specific**:
```

## 6.2 Onboarding Welcome Email

**Subject**: Your audit trail starts now
**Preheader**: Every action from this point forward is logged, timestamped, and tamper-proof.

---

Hi [First Name],

Welcome to MySDAManager.

Your account is live. Your audit trail has officially started. Every action you take from this point forward -- every document you upload, every incident you record, every inspection you complete -- is logged with an immutable, hash-chained audit entry that cannot be altered or deleted.

Here are three things to do in your first 10 minutes:

1. **Add your first property.** Go to Properties and enter your first SDA dwelling. The system will prompt you for the details that matter for compliance: design category, fire safety cert dates, building compliance status.

2. **Upload a compliance document.** Any certificate -- fire safety, SDA registration, worker screening. The system will automatically track its expiry date and alert you before it lapses.

3. **Explore your dashboard.** Your compliance status is visible at a glance. Green means current. Yellow means expiring soon. Red means action required.

Every major page has a built-in SOP guide (the help icon in the top-right). These are step-by-step procedures aligned with NDIS Practice Standards, not generic FAQs.

Your compliance system is live. Start using it.

## 6.3 LinkedIn Post Example

```
SDA management is not a rent collection business.

It is an evidence collection business.

Every missed inspection is a gap in your audit trail.
Every undocumented phone call is a conversation that
never happened. Every expired certificate is ammunition
against you when the Commission comes knocking.

The providers who survive audits are not the ones who
work the hardest. They are the ones who can produce
evidence the fastest. Timestamped. Organised. Complete.

That is why we built MySDAManager as an automated
evidence machine for SDA providers:

-- Evidence Vault: Every document tracked with expiry
   alerts. Nothing slips through.

-- Compliance Watchdog: Real-time compliance status
   across every property in your portfolio.

-- Audit Pack Generator: Complete 7-section NDIS
   audit evidence pack in one click.

The question is not whether you are a compliant provider.
The question is whether you can prove it.

## 6.4 Sales Presentation Opening (First 90 Seconds)

"Good morning. I appreciate your time.

I want to start with a question. If the NDIS Commission called you right now and asked for your complete incident history with chain of custody, your current fire safety certificates for every property, your complaints register with acknowledgment evidence, and your participant consent records -- how long would it take you to produce all of that?

If the answer is more than 15 minutes, you have the same problem every SDA provider I have spoken with has. Not a practice problem. An evidence problem.

MySDAManager exists to solve that. It is the only platform in Australia built specifically for SDA property management and NDIS compliance. Not a rostering tool adapted for properties. Not a generic property manager adapted for NDIS. Purpose-built for the SDA regulatory environment.

Let me show you how it works."

## 6.5 Support Ticket Response Example

**Issue**: User cannot find uploaded document in Compliance Watchdog.

---

Hi [Name],

The document you uploaded on 12/02/2026 ("FP1500 - 42 Oak Street") is stored in the Evidence Vault and is accessible from the Documents page. However, it is not appearing in the Compliance Watchdog because it was uploaded without an expiry date.

The Compliance Watchdog only monitors documents that have an expiry date set. Documents without expiry dates are stored but not tracked for renewal.

**To fix this:**

1. Go to Documents
2. Find "FP1500 - 42 Oak Street"
3. Click the document to open its details
4. Enter the expiry date in the Expiry Date field
5. Save

Once the expiry date is set, the Compliance Watchdog will begin monitoring it and send alerts at 90, 60, and 30 days before expiry.

Let me know if you need anything else.
