## 1. Competitor Analysis & Pricing Research

### Direct Competitors (NDIS/SDA Software)

| Software | Target Market | Pricing Model | Notes |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **Re-Leased** | Property managers | $2,500 onboarding + $5,000/year (25 properties) | ~$417/month, $16.67/property/month |
| **Lumary** | Large providers | Enterprise (custom quote) | Built on Salesforce, premium tier |
| **SupportAbility** | Small-medium providers | Mid-range (custom quote) | Popular, mid-market positioning |
| **Careview** | All sizes | Flexible, no fixed contracts | 143,000+ users, 800+ orgs |
| **CareVision** | NDIS providers | Custom quote | Focus on disability services |

### Re-Leased Pricing Breakdown
- **Onboarding**: $2,500 (one-time)
- **Annual**: $5,000/year for up to 25 properties
- **Per property**: ~$200/property/year (~$16.67/month)
- **Monthly equivalent**: ~$417/month
- **Focus**: Commercial properties (NOT SDA-specific)
- **Problem**: SDA providers need workarounds to use it

**Key Insight**: SDA providers are paying $7,500+ year one for software that wasn't built for them. They're adapting commercial property software to SDA needs.

**Your Opportunity**:
- Purpose-built for SDA from day one
- No workarounds needed
- Understands NDIS pricing, RRC, SDA categories, participant plans
- Half the price with no onboarding fee

### Property Management Software (Reference)

| Software | Pricing | Model |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **PropertyMe** | $176-$330/month | Per portfolio size (100-200 properties) |
| **Per-property model** | $1.10-$1.80/property/month | Tiered by features |
| **SimplifyEm** | From $25/month | Up to 10 units |
| **RealPage** | $1/unit/month | Unlimited users |

### Key Insight
There is **no dedicated SDA-specific SaaS** in the market. Most NDIS software focuses on plan management or support coordination, not property/dwelling management for SDA providers. This is a gap.

## 5. User Experience & Onboarding

### Onboarding Models Comparison

| Model | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|-------|------|------|----------|
| **Self-service** | Scales, low cost | Higher churn | Simple products |
| **High-touch** | Better conversion | Expensive, doesn't scale | Enterprise |
| **Hybrid** | Best of both | Complexity | **Recommended** |

### Recommended Hybrid Approach

#### Self-Service Path
1. **Sign up** → Email only, no credit card
2. **Onboarding wizard** → Add first property, dwelling, participant
3. **Interactive tutorials** → Tooltips, guided tours
4. **Sample data** → Pre-populated demo data to explore
5. **Progress checklist** → "Complete your setup: 3/7 steps done"

#### High-Touch Elements
- **Welcome email sequence** (automated, 5-7 emails over 14 days)
- **Optional onboarding call** → Free 30-min setup session
- **Chat support** → During trial period
- **Webinars** → Weekly "Getting Started" sessions

### Key UX Principles

1. **Time to Value < 5 minutes**
   - User should see their first property/participant within 5 mins
   - Don't require complete setup before showing value

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Show basic features first
   - Unlock advanced features as they explore

3. **Contextual Help**
   - Help buttons near complex features
   - Video tutorials embedded where needed

4. **Mobile-First**
   - Property managers often on-site
   - PWA already implemented

### Comparison to Competitors

| Aspect | Lumary | SupportAbility | **SDAManager** |
|--------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Trial | Demo only | Demo only | **Free 14-day trial** |
| Setup | Sales required | Sales required | **Self-service + optional call** |
| Pricing | Hidden | Hidden | **Transparent on website** |
