## Sample Posts (Ready to Use)

### Post 1: LinkedIn - Compliance Pillar (Educational)

```
Most SDA providers know about the 24-hour reporting rule.

But here is what catches people out:

The 24-hour clock starts from when you BECOME AWARE of the incident
-- not when it happened.

If a participant reports something on Monday that happened on Friday,
your 24 hours starts Monday.

And it is not just the NDIS Commission notification. You also need:

- Internal documentation within the hour
- Participant and family notification
- Staff debriefing
- Corrective action plan within 5 business days

The providers who handle this well are the ones with a system
already in place BEFORE the incident happens.

That is why we built incident tracking with automatic compliance
timelines directly into MySDAManager.

What is your current process for incident documentation?

### Post 2: Twitter/X - Efficiency Pillar (Thread)

```
Tweet 1:
SDA property managers spend an average of 12 hours per week
on paperwork that could be automated.

Here are 5 tasks you should never do manually again:

(thread)

Tweet 2:
1. Maintenance request tracking

Still using email chains and spreadsheets?
Every forwarded email is a compliance risk.

A proper system logs the request, assigns it, tracks it,
and keeps the audit trail. Automatically.

Tweet 3:
2. Document expiry monitoring

Insurance certificates. Fire safety reports. NDIS registrations.

If you are manually checking dates in a folder somewhere,
you WILL miss one. It is not a question of if, but when.

Tweet 4:
3. Participant plan tracking

NDIS plans expire. Funding changes.
If you find out a plan expired last month, you have already
lost revenue.

Automated alerts 30 days before expiry = no surprises.

Tweet 5:
4. Inspection checklists

Paper checklists get lost. Photos get mixed up.
Reports take hours to compile.

Digital checklists with inline photos and auto-generated
PDF reports. Done in the field, available immediately.

Tweet 6:
5. Payment reconciliation

Matching SDA payments to participants across multiple
properties should not take half a day.

Automated matching + variance alerts when something
does not add up.

Tweet 7:
We built MySDAManager to eliminate these 5 time sinks
for SDA providers.

What is your biggest time waster in SDA management?

### Post 3: Instagram - Impact Pillar (Carousel)

```
Caption:
Quality SDA is not just about bricks and mortar.
It is about independence, dignity, and choice.

Every maintenance request resolved quickly is a participant
whose home works the way it should.

Every compliance check completed on time is a provider
who can focus on what matters -- their participants.

Every document tracked automatically is one less thing
standing between a person and the support they need.

That is why we built MySDAManager.
Not just software. A better way to manage disability housing.

### Post 4: Facebook - Industry Pillar (Discussion Starter)

```
Australia currently has a significant gap between SDA supply
and demand.

The NDIS has approved SDA funding for thousands of participants,
but finding the right property in the right location with the
right design category remains a challenge.

For SDA providers, this means:

- High demand, but matching is complex
- Every vacancy day is lost revenue
- Getting the right participant into the right dwelling matters
  more than filling beds quickly

How are you managing vacancy tracking and participant matching
in your SDA portfolio?

We would love to hear what is working (and what is not)
for providers across Australia.

### Post 5: LinkedIn - Behind the Scenes Pillar (Founder Story)

```
6 months ago, I watched an SDA provider track 47 properties
across 3 different spreadsheets, a shared inbox, and a
physical filing cabinet.

Compliance deadlines were missed.
Maintenance requests fell through the cracks.
Participant documents expired without anyone noticing.

Not because they did not care. They cared deeply.
But the tools were not built for SDA.

Generic property management software does not understand
NDIS funding periods, SDA design categories, or
incident reporting obligations.

So we built something that does.

MySDAManager is purpose-built for Australian SDA providers:
- NDIS-specific compliance tracking
- Participant plan and funding management
- Automated alerts for every deadline that matters
- Mobile inspections with photo evidence
- Audit-ready documentation at the click of a button

We are currently onboarding our first providers.

If you manage SDA properties and want to see how it works,
I would genuinely love to show you.
