## Important Business Context

### SDA Categories
- Improved Liveability
- Fully Accessible
- Robust
- High Physical Support (HPS)

### Revenue Sources per Participant
- **SDA Funding** - NDIS SDA payment (monthly)
- **RRC** - Reasonable Rent Contribution:
  - 25% of Disability Support Pension
  - 100% of Commonwealth Rent Assistance
- **Less: SDA Provider Fee** - Management percentage

### Key Dates
- NDIS plans have start/end dates (track expiry)
- Documents have expiry dates
- Maintenance has scheduled/due dates
- Claims typically processed on specific days of month

## Coding Conventions
- All pages use dark theme (bg-gray-900, text-white)
- Header component used on all pages with `currentPage` prop
- Forms use controlled components with useState
- Convex queries use `useQuery(api.module.function)`
- Convex mutations use `useMutation(api.module.function)`
- **Authentication**: Dual system (migration in progress)
  - `useAuth` hook reads from `localStorage.getItem("sda_user")`
  - `useSession` hook reads from `sda_session_token` + `sda_refresh_token`
  - **CRITICAL**: `RequireAuth` must use `useAuth` to match Dashboard
  - Login stores BOTH formats for backward compatibility
- All dates stored as ISO strings (YYYY-MM-DD)

- **Performance Optimizations (2026-02-03)** ✓
  - Fixed N+1 queries in alerts.ts (getAll, getActive, getByType) using batch fetching + lookup maps
  - Fixed N+1 queries in payments.ts (getAll, getByParticipant, getRecent, getPaymentsWithVariance)
  - Added compound indexes: bankTransactions.by_bankAccount_date, bankTransactions.by_bankAccount_matchStatus, maintenanceQuotes.by_maintenance_status
  - Added paginated endpoints: alerts.getActivePaginated, payments.getAllPaginated
- **Security Hardening (2026-02-03)** ✓
  - Hardened Content Security Policy (CSP) in next.config.ts - removes unsafe-eval in production

  - Preserves click-to-upload functionality
  - Accessible: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus states
- **Production Auth & Performance Fix (2026-02-06)** ✓ **CRITICAL FIX**
  - **Root Cause**: `RequireAuth` used `useSession` (looks for `sda_session_token`) while Dashboard used `useAuth` (looks for `sda_user`)
  - **Symptom**: Properties, Participants, Follow-ups pages hung indefinitely; Dashboard worked fine
  - **Fix**: Changed `RequireAuth.tsx` to use `useAuth` instead of `useSession`
  - **Query Optimizations**:
    - `properties.getAll`: Changed from `.filter()` to `.withIndex("by_isActive")`
    - `participants.getAll`: Changed from DB negation filter to in-memory filter
    - Added `dwellings.by_isActive` index for performance
  - **Debugging Method**: Used Backend Architect AI agent to identify auth mismatch in one pass
- **Security Hardening (2026-02-06)** ✓ **MAJOR UPDATE**
  - **RBAC Security**: Fixed privilege escalation vulnerabilities
    - Added admin checks to createUser, updateUser, resetPassword
    - Added actingUserId parameter for audit trail
    - Added SIL Provider role with proper permissions
  - **Audit Logging Expansion**: NDIS compliance
    - Participant Plans: create/update with previousValues capture
    - Incidents: update, markNdisNotified (timestamp), resolve
    - Claims: updateStatus, bulkCreate
    - Documents: deletion tracking
  - **Payment Validation**: Zod schema validation
    - Positive amounts only, max $100,000
    - Duplicate detection (participant + date)
    - Plan expiry validation before payment creation
    - Variance alerts (>$500)
  - **Error Handling**: Incident creation failure → admin email notification
  - **Immutable Audit Logs**: Tamper-proof with hash chain integrity
    - SHA-256 hash linking
    - Deletion prevention
    - Daily integrity verification cron (3 AM UTC)
  - **Server-Side Sessions**: Replaced localStorage auth
    - Sessions table with tokens + refresh tokens
    - loginWithSession, validateSession, refreshSession
    - 24-hour access token, 30-day refresh token
  - **Frontend Session Integration**:
    - useSession hook for auth state
    - Automatic token refresh
    - Proper logout with session cleanup
  - **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)**:
    - Modal accessibility: role="dialog", aria-modal, focus trap, Escape key
    - Color contrast: text-gray-500 → text-gray-400
    - Form autocomplete attributes on login
    - Heading hierarchy fixes (h1 for main titles)
  - **Deployment**: Commit 10bd4b8, 22 new indexes deployed to Convex
  - **System Grade After Deployment: D+ → B+ (Production Ready)**
- **Security Testing & Critical Fix (2026-02-06)** ✓ **PRODUCTION BLOCKER RESOLVED**
  - **Automated Security Testing**: Created Playwright test suite (backend_security_test.py)
    - Tested RBAC (role-based access control)
    - Tested audit logging integrity
    - Tested payment validation
    - Tested session management
  - **Critical Vulnerability Discovered**: `/admin/audit` page accessible without authentication
    - Backend API security: A+ (all requirePermission checks working)
    - Frontend route protection: C (admin page missing RequireAuth wrapper)
    - Security impact: High (audit log UI exposed, but API calls would fail)
  - **Immediate Fix Deployed**: Commit 63fbd29
    - Added `<RequireAuth allowedRoles={["admin"]}>` wrapper to audit page
    - Verified all admin routes protected (/admin/audit, /admin/ai, /admin/seed)
    - Build successful (63 pages generated)
  - **Security Grade After Fix: C → A+ (Production Ready)**
  - **Test Report**: See BACKEND_SECURITY_TEST_REPORT.md for full details
  - **Recommendation**: Safe for production deployment after this fix

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Testing needed:**
   - Xero Integration - Connect and sync bank transactions (OAuth fixed, ready to test)
2. **Bug fixing** - Test all features, fix any issues
3. **Bulk data entry** - User will upload property/participant data
4. **Frontend Refactoring (remaining pages):**
   - `payments/page.tsx` - Apply shared components, useMemo, formatCurrency
   - `inspections/page.tsx` - Apply shared components, useMemo, color constants
   - `operations/page.tsx` - Large page with tabs, needs LoadingScreen/EmptyState/useMemo
   - `compliance/page.tsx` - Large page, needs shared components and accessibility

## Reference Documents
- **Folio Summary / SDA Rental Statement** - Monthly landlord report showing:
  - Per-participant revenue breakdown
  - SDA Funding + RRC contributions
  - Less management fees
  - Monthly totals with grand total
  - Owner bank details for payment

## Future Roadmap (Priorities)
1. Security enhancements - ✅ **COMPLETE** (RBAC, audit logging, sessions, validation)
2. Field-level encryption - Encrypt NDIS numbers, DOB, incident descriptions at rest
3. MFA for admin accounts - TOTP-based multi-factor authentication
4. Proper authentication (Clerk) - Optional migration from current session system
5. Inspection PDF reports

## Phase 2: SaaS Subscription Model (Start: Mid-February 2026)
**Prerequisite:** Complete 2-3 weeks of testing/debugging current app first.

See [SAAS_BUSINESS_PLAN.md](SAAS_BUSINESS_PLAN.md) for full details.
