## Post 1: The $10,000 Spreadsheet

**Best posting time**: Tuesday 8:00 AM AEST

---

That spreadsheet tracking your SDA compliance is the most expensive tool in your business.

Not because of what it costs. Because of what it misses.

I have spoken with SDA providers who lost their NDIS registration -- not because they were doing the wrong thing, but because they could not prove they were doing the right thing. Their evidence was scattered across Excel files, email inboxes, and filing cabinets that nobody had opened in months.

Here is what spreadsheets cannot do:

-- They cannot alert you 30 days before a fire safety certificate expires.
-- They cannot timestamp the exact chain of custody on an incident report.
-- They cannot prove you acknowledged a complaint within 24 hours.
-- They cannot generate an audit-ready evidence pack when the Commission calls.

The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission does not care how hard you work. They care what you can prove. And "I think it's in a spreadsheet somewhere" is not evidence. It is a liability.

The real cost of that spreadsheet is not the $0 you paid for it. It is the $10,000+ in audit remediation, the months of conditional registration, and the reputational damage that follows.

Your compliance system should work harder than you do.

## Post 2: The "Dodgy Provider" Crackdown

**Best posting time**: Wednesday 8:30 AM AEST

---

The NDIS Commission is not coming for "dodgy providers" someday. They are doing it right now.

Enforcement actions are increasing. Registrations are being revoked. And the providers getting caught are not all bad actors -- some of them simply could not produce their records fast enough.

Here is a 5-point compliance check every SDA and SIL provider should be able to pass today:

1. Current fire safety statements for every property you manage -- not expired, not "we are waiting on the contractor," current.

2. Signed consent forms for every participant -- with documented evidence of when consent was given, what it covers, and when it needs renewal.

3. A documented complaints handling procedure that follows the Commission's guidelines -- with proof that every complaint was acknowledged within the required timeframe.

4. Incident reports with full timestamps and chain of custody -- showing exactly who was notified, when they were notified, and what actions were taken within the 24-hour and 5-day windows.

5. Evidence of regular property inspections -- with dated photos, identified defects, and documented follow-up actions.

If you cannot prove all five of these in 15 minutes, you have a problem.

Not a "we should probably get around to that" problem. A "the Commission could contact us tomorrow" problem.

## Post 3: Collecting Evidence, Not Just Rent

**Best posting time**: Tuesday 8:15 AM AEST

---

SDA management is not a rent collection business. It is an evidence collection business.

Every missed inspection is a gap in your audit trail. Every undocumented phone call is a conversation that never happened. Every expired certificate is ammunition against you when the NDIS Commission comes knocking.

And they are knocking more often.

The providers who survive audits are not the ones who work the hardest. They are the ones who can produce evidence the fastest. Timestamped. Organised. Complete.

That is why we built MySDAManager as an automated evidence machine for SDA and SIL providers:

-- Evidence Vault: Every document, certificate, consent form, and inspection report stored with expiry tracking and automatic renewal alerts. Nothing slips through the cracks.

-- Compliance Watchdog: Real-time monitoring of your compliance status across every property, every participant, every contractor. You see exactly where the gaps are before an auditor does.

-- Audit Pack Generator: One click to produce a complete, 7-section NDIS audit evidence pack -- certifications, incident history, complaints register, participant plans, document expiry status, and audit log integrity. Ready in minutes, not weeks.

The question is not whether you are a compliant provider. The question is whether you can prove it at 9 AM on a Monday when the Commission calls.

## Campaign Notes

**Posting cadence**: One post per week across three consecutive weeks. Rotate between Tuesday and Wednesday mornings at 8:00-8:30 AM AEST, which aligns with peak LinkedIn engagement for Australian B2B audiences.

**Engagement strategy**: After posting, engage with comments for the first 60 minutes to boost algorithmic reach. Reply to every comment with a question to extend the thread.

**Repurposing opportunities**:
- Post 1 can be adapted into a short-form video (60 seconds, talking head with text overlay)
- Post 2 checklist can become a downloadable PDF lead magnet
- Post 3 feature highlights can feed a product demo landing page

**A/B testing**: Consider testing Post 2 with an alternative opening line: "5 things the NDIS Commission checks first in an SDA audit" -- a utility-first hook versus the fear-based hook above.

**Follow-up content**: After the three posts, publish a case study or testimonial post showing a real provider who passed an audit using the platform. Social proof reinforces the fear-based messaging with a positive resolution.
