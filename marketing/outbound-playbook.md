## Section 1: LinkedIn Outreach

### 1.1 Connection Request Templates

All connection requests must be under 300 characters (LinkedIn limit). Personalise with the recipient's name, company, or a specific observation.

---

**Template A: For small providers (5-15 properties)**

Hi {first_name}, I saw that {company_name} manages SDA properties in {location}. I am building a platform specifically for SDA providers -- the first purpose-built option in Australia. Would love to connect and hear how you manage your portfolio.

---

**Template B: For mid-sized providers (15-30 properties)**

Hi {first_name}, I work with SDA providers managing 15-50 properties who are outgrowing spreadsheets. I built MySDAManager to solve the "too many systems" problem. Would be great to connect -- happy to share some SDA compliance resources.

---

**Template C: For large/growing providers (30-50+ properties)**

Hi {first_name}, {company_name} has an impressive SDA portfolio. I am researching how larger providers manage compliance at scale and would value your perspective. I run MySDAManager -- Australia's only SDA-specific management platform.

---

### 1.2 Follow-Up Message Sequence (5 Messages Over 3 Weeks)

**Timing**: Only send after connection is accepted. Space messages 3-5 days apart.

---

**Message 1 -- Day 1 (After connection accepted)**

Thanks for connecting, {first_name}. I noticed {company_name} operates in the SDA space -- always good to connect with people who understand the sector.

Quick question: what is the biggest operational challenge your team faces right now? I ask because we hear the same handful of answers from nearly every provider we speak with, and I am curious whether your experience matches.

No pitch -- genuinely interested in the conversation.

---

**Message 2 -- Day 4**

{first_name}, I wanted to share something useful. We put together a 2026 NDIS SDA Audit Readiness Checklist that has been popular with providers. It is a 10-point self-assessment you can work through in about 15 minutes.

Happy to send it over if you are interested -- just let me know.

---

**Message 3 -- Day 9**

Hi {first_name}, I have been thinking about something relevant to {company_name}. Most SDA providers I speak with manage their operations across 3 to 5 separate systems -- spreadsheets, shared drives, email, accounting software, and some kind of task management tool.

The average time cost: 12-15 hours per week in data re-entry and document searching alone.

We built MySDAManager to consolidate all of that into one platform -- purpose-built for SDA, not adapted from rostering or residential property software.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if it is relevant to your operation? No obligation -- I can share the demo and you can decide from there.

---

**Message 4 -- Day 14**

{first_name}, I wanted to follow up briefly. I know you are busy, so I will be direct:

MySDAManager includes an Audit Pack Generator that creates a 7-section NDIS compliance PDF in one click. Providers who were spending 3-4 days preparing for audits are now doing it in 10 minutes.

If audit preparation is something your team spends significant time on, this one feature alone might be worth a conversation.

15 minutes: https://mysdamanager.com/contact

If the timing is not right, no worries at all -- happy to stay connected.

---

**Message 5 -- Day 21 (Final)**

Hi {first_name}, this is my last follow-up -- I do not want to be that person who sends 20 messages.

If MySDAManager is not relevant to {company_name} right now, I completely understand. The SDA market is growing and your priorities may shift in the future.

I will continue sharing SDA insights and compliance content here on LinkedIn. If anything resonates or your needs change, my door is always open.

All the best with {company_name}.

### 1.3 Profile Optimisation Checklist (For Sales Team)

Every team member conducting LinkedIn outreach should optimise their profile:

**Headline** (120 characters max):
- "Helping SDA providers replace spreadsheets with purpose-built compliance tools | Founder, MySDAManager"
- "SDA property management technology | Reducing compliance risk for NDIS providers"
- Do NOT use: "CEO" or generic titles without context

**About section** (2,600 characters max):
- First paragraph: The problem you solve (SDA providers using 3-5 disconnected systems)
- Second paragraph: What MySDAManager does (purpose-built SDA management)
- Third paragraph: Who you help (providers managing 5-50 properties)
- Fourth paragraph: Credibility (features, security, compliance focus)
- Final line: CTA (book a demo, visit website)
- Include keywords: SDA, NDIS, Specialist Disability Accommodation, compliance, property management

**Profile photo**: Professional headshot, friendly expression, clean background
**Banner image**: MySDAManager branded banner with tagline and URL
**Featured section**: Pin 2-3 items:
  1. Audit Readiness Checklist (lead magnet)
  2. Best-performing LinkedIn post
  3. Demo booking link

**Experience section**:
- Current role: Rich description of MySDAManager with bullet points
- Include media: product screenshots, explainer video link

**Skills**: SDA, NDIS, Property Management, Compliance, SaaS, Disability Services

### 1.4 Content Engagement Strategy

Before sending outreach, engage with the prospect's content for 1-2 weeks:

**Week 1 -- Passive engagement**:
- Like 3-5 of their recent posts
- Leave 1 thoughtful comment (not "great post!" -- add value or perspective)
- Share one of their posts if genuinely relevant

**Week 2 -- Active engagement**:
- Comment on another post with a question or insight
- React to their comments on other people's posts
- Send the connection request (they will now recognise your name)

**Rules**:
- Never mention MySDAManager in comments on their posts (that is spam)
- Keep comments about the topic, not your product
- Be genuinely helpful -- recommend resources, share relevant data, answer questions
- Only move to DM outreach after the connection is accepted

---

## Section 2: Cold Email

### 2.1 Five-Email Cold Outreach Sequence

**Sending**: From khen@mysdamanager.com (founder email for credibility)
**Frequency**: Space emails 3-5 business days apart
**Personalisation**: Each email includes at least one personalised element (company name, location, property count, recent news)
**Compliance**: Australian Spam Act 2003 -- functional unsubscribe in every email, ABN identification, clear sender identity

---

**Email 1: The Problem**

**Subject A**: {company_name} + SDA compliance
**Subject B**: How many systems does {company_name} use for SDA management?

Hi {first_name},

I have been researching SDA providers in {state/region} and noticed that {company_name} manages properties in the {design_category} category.

I am reaching out because every SDA provider I speak with describes the same operational challenge: managing properties, participants, compliance, and maintenance across 3 to 5 disconnected systems -- spreadsheets, shared drives, email, and accounting software.

The result: 12 to 15 hours per week lost to data re-entry, document searching, and manual compliance tracking.

MySDAManager is the first platform built specifically for SDA property management. Not adapted from rostering software or residential property tools -- purpose-built for SDA.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if it is relevant to {company_name}?

**Email 2: The Evidence (Day 4)**

**Subject A**: The 4-day audit scramble
**Subject B**: Re: {company_name} + SDA compliance

Hi {first_name},

One quick follow-up.

The most common feedback I hear from SDA providers: "We spent 4 days preparing for our last NDIS audit -- gathering documents from email, shared drives, and filing cabinets."

MySDAManager's Audit Pack Generator produces a comprehensive 7-section NDIS compliance PDF in under 10 seconds. Certifications, incidents, complaints, participant plans, document expiry status, and audit log integrity -- all compiled from data your team entered during normal operations.

4 days becomes 10 minutes.

If audit preparation is a pain point for {company_name}, this one feature alone might be worth a quick conversation.

15 minutes, no obligation: https://mysdamanager.com/contact?utm_source=email&utm_medium=cold&utm_campaign=email2

**Email 3: The Security Angle (Day 9)**

**Subject A**: How {company_name} protects participant NDIS numbers
**Subject B**: AES-256 encryption for SDA participant data

Hi {first_name},

Quick question: are your participants' NDIS numbers, dates of birth, and emergency contact details encrypted at rest?

Under the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme, if this data is accessed without authorisation, you have 72 hours to notify the OAIC and every affected individual.

Most SDA providers store this information in spreadsheets or shared drives with no encryption. That is a significant compliance risk.

MySDAManager encrypts sensitive fields with AES-256 (the same standard used by banks):
- NDIS participant numbers
- Dates of birth
- Emergency contacts
- Owner bank account numbers
- Incident descriptions

Plus role-based access control, MFA for admin accounts, and tamper-proof audit logs with SHA-256 hash chain integrity.

Your participants trust you with their most sensitive data. That trust deserves proper protection.

Worth a conversation? https://mysdamanager.com/contact?utm_source=email&utm_medium=cold&utm_campaign=email3

**Email 4: The ROI (Day 14)**

**Subject A**: $25,980/year in savings for a 15-property provider
**Subject B**: The cost of spreadsheet-based SDA management

Hi {first_name},

I will keep this brief. Here is the maths for a provider managing 15 properties:

**Current cost** (typical spreadsheet + multi-system operation):
- Administrative time: 15 hrs/week x $45/hr = $2,925/month
- Multiple software subscriptions: ~$200/month
- Audit prep (amortised): ~$500/month
- Compliance consultant: ~$417/month
- **Total: ~$4,042/month**

**With MySDAManager** (Professional plan):
- Reduced admin time: 6 hrs/week x $45/hr = $1,170/month
- MySDAManager: $899/month
- Xero: $65/month
- Reduced audit prep: ~$25/month
- Reduced consultant: ~$167/month
- **Total: ~$1,877/month**

**Annual saving: ~$25,980. ROI: 5.8x.**

This does not include avoided audit findings ($10K-$25K each) or reduced vacancy days.

The business case is not close. MySDAManager pays for itself in the first month.

**Email 5: The Breakup (Day 21)**

**Subject A**: Should I stop reaching out?
**Subject B**: Last email from me, {first_name}

Hi {first_name},

I have sent a few emails and have not heard back, which could mean:

(a) You are busy and this is not a priority right now
(b) You have a system that works well for {company_name}
(c) My emails are going to spam

If it is (a), no worries. I will stop emailing but you are welcome to reach out when the timing is better. My inbox is always open: khen@mysdamanager.com

If it is (b), that is great. Genuinely. If your SDA operations are running smoothly, you are doing something right.

If it is (c), well, you are reading this one -- so maybe not.

Either way, I wish {company_name} all the best. The SDA sector needs good providers, and from what I have seen, you are one of them.

If you ever want to explore MySDAManager, the door is always open: mysdamanager.com

### 2.2 Subject Line A/B Variants

Test each pair to determine which approach resonates better:

|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Email 1 | {company_name} + SDA compliance | How many systems does {company_name} use? |

| Recent news | Google News, LinkedIn | "Congratulations on {expansion/award}..." |
| NDIS changes | NDIS Commission announcements | "With the recent changes to {regulation}..." |
| Job postings | SEEK, LinkedIn Jobs | "I noticed you are hiring a property manager -- growing portfolio?" |
| Team size | LinkedIn company page | Small team = time savings angle; large team = coordination angle |

## Section 3: Partnership Strategy

### 3.1 Tier 1: SDA Consultants

**Why**: SDA consultants advise providers on compliance, operations, and growth. They influence purchasing decisions and often recommend tools.

**Value proposition**: "Recommend MySDAManager to your clients and we will give them 1 month free. You earn ongoing referral credit and your clients get better compliance outcomes."

**Referral program structure**:
- Referrer's client receives: 1 month free on any plan
- Referrer receives: 15% revenue share for 12 months (paid monthly)
- Minimum commitment: Client must remain subscribed for 3+ months for referral credit
- Tracking: Unique referral code per consultant

**Partnership email template**:

**Subject**: Partnership opportunity -- SDA compliance technology

Hi {first_name},

I have been following your work helping SDA providers with {specific area -- compliance, operations, growth}. Your expertise in the sector is evident.

I am the founder of MySDAManager, the first platform built specifically for SDA property management. We address a problem I know you see in your consulting work: providers managing compliance across spreadsheets, shared drives, and multiple disconnected systems.

I am building a referral partnership programme for SDA consultants. The concept is straightforward:

- You recommend MySDAManager to clients where it is genuinely a good fit
- Your clients receive 1 month free on any plan
- You receive a 15% revenue share for 12 months per referred client

There is no obligation to recommend us -- only do so when it genuinely serves your client. But if you believe your clients would benefit from purpose-built SDA management with automated compliance monitoring, encrypted participant data, and one-click audit packs, I would love to discuss a partnership.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to see if there is alignment?

### 3.2 Tier 2: NDIS Auditors

**Why**: NDIS auditors see the compliance gaps firsthand. They can recommend tools that make their job easier (and their clients' compliance stronger).

**Value proposition**: "MySDAManager makes your audits faster. Providers using our platform can generate a complete compliance pack in one click. We will co-brand compliance guides with your firm."

**Partnership structure**:
- Co-branded compliance guides (MySDAManager + auditor firm logo)
- Joint webinars on audit preparation
- Auditor receives early access to new compliance features for feedback
- Optional: Auditor referral code for clients (1 month free for client, no revenue share -- keeps independence)

**Partnership email template**:

**Subject**: Making SDA audits easier -- for your clients and your team

Hi {first_name},

As an NDIS auditor, you see the compliance challenges SDA providers face every day: scattered documents, incomplete incident registers, expired certifications that nobody noticed.

I am the founder of MySDAManager, a platform built specifically for SDA property management. Our Audit Pack Generator produces a comprehensive 7-section compliance PDF in one click -- covering certifications, incidents, complaints, participant plans, document expiry, and audit log integrity.

Providers using MySDAManager can produce their complete compliance evidence within minutes of an audit notice. This means:
- Less time waiting for providers to gather documents
- Higher quality evidence (timestamped, linked, hash-chain verified)
- Clearer audit trail for your assessment

I am exploring partnerships with NDIS auditing firms. The idea: co-branded compliance guides that you share with clients, positioning your firm as proactively helping providers improve their compliance posture. We provide the content and technology; you provide the audit expertise and credibility.

No financial arrangement required -- this is about mutual value. Would you be open to a conversation?

### 3.3 Tier 3: SDA Property Developers

**Why**: SDA developers build properties and need management partners. A strong management platform protects their investment and ensures compliance for properties they have built.

**Value proposition**: "Protect your SDA investment with professional property management technology. When your properties are well-managed, your returns are protected and your reputation grows."

**Partnership structure**:
- Developer recommends MySDAManager to providers managing their properties
- Co-marketing: Developer case studies featuring well-managed portfolios
- Developer portal consideration: Future feature for portfolio visibility
- Potential volume discount for developers who mandate MySDAManager for their property managers

**Partnership email template**:

**Subject**: Protecting your SDA portfolio with professional management technology

Hi {first_name},

I noticed that {company_name} is developing SDA properties in {location}. The SDA development market is growing strongly, and the quality of your projects is impressive.

I want to raise a question that many developers do not think about until it becomes a problem: how confident are you that the providers managing your properties have robust compliance systems?

The value of an SDA investment depends on three things: property quality (your strength), participant occupancy, and regulatory compliance. If the provider managing your property loses their NDIS registration due to compliance failures, your property loses its SDA enrolment. That is a direct threat to your returns.

MySDAManager is the first platform built specifically for SDA property management. It ensures that providers managing properties in your portfolio have:
- Automated compliance monitoring (no expired certifications)
- Tamper-proof audit logs (evidence integrity)
- Professional maintenance tracking (property condition protection)
- One-click audit packs (always audit-ready)

I am building partnerships with SDA developers who want assurance that their properties are professionally managed. Would you be open to a conversation about how we can work together?

We built the first platform designed specifically for SDA property management -- compliance monitoring, incident reporting, document management, and audit pack generation in one system. Providers who were spending 4 days preparing for audits are doing it in 10 minutes. If you manage SDA properties and you are tired of workarounds, I would love to show you what purpose-built looks like."

As promised, here is the NDIS SDA Audit Readiness Checklist we discussed: {link}

{If they expressed interest in a demo}:
I would love to schedule that demo we talked about. Here is my calendar: {link}

{If general conversation}:

**Email 2 -- 7 days after event**

**Subject**: Following up from {event_name}

Hi {first_name},

A week on from {event_name}, I have been reflecting on the conversations I had with SDA providers. The theme was consistent: compliance is manageable at 5 properties but becomes overwhelming at 15+.

If {company_name} is in that growth phase -- or heading there -- MySDAManager is built to scale with you. The Compliance Watchdog, Evidence Vault, and Audit Pack Generator work just as well at 50 properties as they do at 5.

Would a 15-minute demo be useful? No obligation, just a walkthrough of how the platform addresses the challenges you mentioned at the event.

Book a time: https://mysdamanager.com/contact?utm_source=email&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign={event_code}

**Email 3 -- 14 days after event (final)**

**Subject**: Last follow-up from {event_name}

Hi {first_name},

This is my last follow-up from {event_name}. I do not want to be persistent beyond what is useful.

If MySDAManager is not a priority for {company_name} right now, I understand completely. The SDA sector is busy and there is always more to do than time allows.

Two things I will leave you with:

1. Our 14-day free trial is always available -- no credit card, no commitment: mysdamanager.com
2. I share SDA compliance tips and market insights on LinkedIn every week. If you are not already connected, you can find me at {LinkedIn profile URL}.

Best of luck with {company_name}. The sector needs good providers.

## Section 6: Outbound Operations

### 6.1 Prospecting Process

**Step 1: Identify prospects**
- NDIS Provider Register (publicly available): Filter for SDA-registered providers
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator: Filter by industry, location, company size
- SDA listing websites: Identify active providers by property listings
- Google search: "SDA provider [city/region]", "specialist disability accommodation [state]"
- Event attendee lists (from sponsored events)

**Step 2: Research and qualify**
- Minimum: Company name, contact person, email, estimated property count
- Ideal: Design categories, locations, team size, current technology, recent news
- Disqualify: Providers with fewer than 3 properties (not yet ready), providers already using a competitor product

**Step 3: Personalise and send**
- Choose appropriate outreach channel (LinkedIn or cold email -- not both simultaneously)
- Personalise first message with specific research
- Enter into appropriate sequence

**Step 4: Track and follow up**
- Log all outreach in CRM (or spreadsheet for early stage)
- Track: date sent, response, next action, outcome
- Never send more than 5 emails or 5 LinkedIn messages without a response
- Respect "not interested" -- remove from sequence immediately

### 6.2 Weekly Outbound Cadence

| Day | Activity | Target |
|-----|----------|--------|
| Monday | Research and prospect identification | 10 new prospects |
| Tuesday | LinkedIn outreach (connection requests + follow-ups) | 15 messages |
| Wednesday | Cold email sends (new + follow-ups) | 20 emails |
| Thursday | Follow-up on responses, demo scheduling | 5 conversations |
| Friday | Partnership outreach + event planning | 3 partnership contacts |

**Weekly targets**:
- 10 new prospects researched and added to CRM
- 15 LinkedIn messages sent (mix of new and follow-up)
- 20 cold emails sent (mix of new and follow-up)
- 3 demos booked
- 1 partnership conversation

### 6.3 Demo Structure (15 Minutes)

**Minute 0-2: Discovery**
"Before I show you the platform, I would like to understand your current setup. How many SDA properties do you manage? What tools are you using today? What is the biggest pain point?"

**Minute 2-5: Problem validation**
Mirror their pain points back to them. "So if I understand correctly, you are spending X hours on Y, and your main concern is Z. Is that right?"

**Minute 5-12: Targeted demo**
Show ONLY the features that address their stated pain points. Do not demo everything. Common paths:

- Compliance pain: Evidence Vault > Compliance Watchdog > Audit Pack Generator
- Administrative burden: Property setup > Participant management > Maintenance workflow
- Security concern: Encryption overview > RBAC > Audit logs
- Financial management: Payment tracking > Xero integration > Owner reports

**Minute 12-14: ROI and pricing**
"Based on what you have told me about your operation, the Professional plan at $899/month would give you [specific benefits]. Providers of your size typically see [specific savings]."

**Minute 14-15: Next steps**
"Would you like to start a 14-day trial? I can set up your account right now and pre-load your first few properties. Or if you would like to discuss this with your team first, I can send a summary email with everything we covered."

### 6.4 Objection Handling

**"We are too small for software."**
"I hear that often. The interesting thing is that smaller providers (5-15 properties) are actually where compliance risk is highest, because you have fewer people managing the same obligations as larger providers. MySDAManager starts at $499/month -- less than $17/day. Most providers of your size save 8-10 hours per week in admin time alone."

**"We have a system that works."**
"That is great. Can I ask -- if an auditor called tomorrow, how long would it take to produce a complete compliance evidence pack? If it is under an hour, your system really does work. If it is longer, there might be value in a conversation about how MySDAManager handles that."

**"The price is too high."**
"I understand budget is always a consideration. Let me ask: how many hours per week does your team spend on admin tasks like data entry, document searching, and manual compliance tracking? At $45/hour, even saving 6 hours per week more than covers the subscription cost. The question is not whether you can afford the software -- it is whether you can afford the admin time you are spending without it."

**"We are not ready to change systems right now."**
"Completely understand. Timing matters. Would it be useful if I sent you our Audit Readiness Checklist and stayed in touch? When the timing is right -- or when your next audit approaches -- you will already know what MySDAManager can do."

**"What about ShiftCare / Brevity / CTARS?"**
"Those are excellent tools for rostering and billing -- they solve the SIL provider's problem. But they are not property management platforms. They do not track SDA design categories, compliance certifications, maintenance lifecycles, or generate NDIS audit packs. MySDAManager is not competing with those tools -- we complement them. Many of our users also use rostering software for their support worker scheduling."

**"Can we just use spreadsheets?"**
"You can, and many providers do. Spreadsheets work until they do not. The inflection point is usually around 10 properties or your first audit finding -- whichever comes first. The question is whether you want to invest in proper tooling proactively (controlled, planned) or reactively (urgent, expensive). MySDAManager is here when you are ready."

## Appendix: Key Talking Points

### Unique Value Proposition (One Line)
MySDAManager is Australia's only purpose-built SDA property management platform -- replacing the 3 to 5 disconnected systems every provider currently uses with one integrated solution.

### Three Key Differentiators

1. **Purpose-built for SDA**: Not adapted from rostering software (ShiftCare, Brevity, CTARS) or generic property management (PropertyMe). SDA design categories, NDIS plan tracking, and compliance monitoring are native features, not custom fields.

2. **Compliance by design**: Evidence is generated automatically as your team works. The Audit Pack Generator compiles 7 sections of compliance evidence in one click. Tamper-proof audit logs with SHA-256 hash chain integrity.

3. **Bank-grade security**: AES-256 encryption at rest for NDIS numbers, DOB, bank details. Role-based access control. MFA for admin accounts. Inactivity lock screen. All this at every price point -- not reserved for enterprise.

### The "Workaround" Story
"It is always a workaround. Every SDA provider I speak with tells me the same thing. They have built their operations on spreadsheets, shared drives, and email -- not because these are the right tools, but because no right tool existed. MySDAManager is the end of workarounds."

### Pricing Justification
"Our Starter plan at $499/month works out to less than $17/day. For a provider spending 12+ hours per week on admin tasks at $45/hour, the software saves $2,000+ per month in labour costs alone. The ROI is typically 4-5x within the first month."
