# MySDAManager Social Media Brand Kit

**Brand**: MySDAManager
**URL**: https://mysdamanager.com
**Industry**: NDIS Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) compliance software
**Market**: Australian SDA and SIL providers
**Version**: 1.0 | February 2026

---

## Brand Foundation

### Mission Statement
Replace manual compliance tracking with automated evidence collection so SDA providers can prove they are doing the right thing -- every time the NDIS Commission asks.

### Brand Positioning
MySDAManager is the compliance operating system built by an SDA provider, for SDA providers. It is not generic property management software adapted for disability housing. It is purpose-built for the NDIS regulatory environment where documentation gaps cost registrations.

### Core Value Proposition
One platform to manage properties, participants, maintenance, incidents, and compliance -- with an automated evidence vault that generates audit-ready packs in minutes, not weeks.

### Instagram Caption Templates

**Tile 1 caption**:
```
73% of NDIS audit findings come down to one thing: documentation gaps.

Not bad practice. Not negligence. Just missing evidence.

Your compliance system should catch the gaps before an auditor does. MySDAManager tracks every document, certificate, and consent form with automatic expiry alerts so nothing slips through.

Link in bio.

#NDIS #SDA #DisabilityHousing #NDISCompliance #SDAProvider #AuditReady #NDISAudit #PropertyManagement #DisabilityAccommodation
```

**Tile 2 caption**:
```
Fire safety certificates. Building compliance. NDIS practice standards. Worker screening checks.

Each one has an expiry date. Each one needs renewal. And each one is checked during an audit.

MySDAManager monitors every certificate across every property and alerts you 30 days before expiry. No more spreadsheet hunting.

Link in bio.

#NDIS #SDA #FireSafety #Compliance #FP1500 #SDAProvider #NDISProvider #PropertyManagement #DisabilityHousing
```

**Tile 3 caption**:
```
Consent is not a one-time event. It is a living document.

APP 3 of the Australian Privacy Principles requires informed, documented consent for the collection and use of personal information. That consent can be withdrawn at any time, and it can expire.

MySDAManager tracks consent status for every participant with automatic renewal alerts and a full Easy Read consent PDF generator.

Link in bio.

#NDIS #SDA #Consent #PrivacyPrinciples #APP3 #NDISCompliance #SDAProvider #DisabilityRights #Participant
```

**Tile 4 caption**:
```
When the NDIS Commission calls, you have one question to answer: can you produce the evidence?

The Evidence Vault generates a complete 7-section audit pack in one click:
-- Certifications and registrations
-- Incident history and response timelines
-- Complaints register with resolution tracking
-- Participant plan summaries
-- Document expiry status
-- Immutable audit log with hash chain integrity

Minutes, not weeks. That is the difference.

Every SDA provider I speak with has the same problem.

Not bad practice. Not negligence. Just scattered evidence.

Fire safety certificates in a shared drive. Incident reports in someone's email. Consent forms in a filing cabinet. Contractor records in a different spreadsheet.

The NDIS Commission does not care how hard you work. They care what you can prove. And "I think it's in a spreadsheet somewhere" is not evidence. It is a liability.

That is why we built MySDAManager -- the compliance operating system designed by an SDA provider, for SDA providers.

Swipe through to see what changes when your compliance runs itself.

### 4.3 Logo Usage

**Primary logo**: `mysda-logo-dark.svg` -- white logotype on transparent background. Designed for dark backgrounds.

**Minimum size**: 100px wide for digital, 25mm wide for print.

**Clear space**: Maintain a clear zone around the logo equal to the height of the "M" in "MySDA" on all sides. No text, icons, or other elements should encroach on this space.

**Placement rules**:
- Social media tiles: Bottom-left of the brand footer strip
- LinkedIn banner: Left side, vertically centred in the safe zone
- Carousel slides: Bottom-left of the brand bar on every slide
- Email signatures: Left-aligned, 120px wide

**Background requirements**:
- Always place the logo on backgrounds darker than #374151 (gray-700)
- Never place the white logo on light or white backgrounds
- If a light background is unavoidable, use a dark version of the logo (to be created)

**Prohibited modifications**:
- Do not rotate, skew, or distort the logo
- Do not add drop shadows, glows, or outlines to the logo
- Do not change the logo colours
- Do not place the logo inside a coloured box or circle
- Do not recreate the logo in a different font

### 4.4 Tone of Voice

**Brand personality**: Authoritative, direct, peer-to-peer, compliance-focused.

MySDAManager speaks as an experienced colleague who has been through NDIS audits, not as a software vendor pitching features. The tone is informed by real operational knowledge of SDA management and NDIS compliance requirements.

**Voice principles**:

1. **Speak from experience, not from theory.**
   Write as someone who has managed SDA properties and faced NDIS audits. Reference real compliance requirements (FP1500, APP 3, SOP-001, 24-hour notification windows) by name. Never speak in vague generalities about "compliance challenges."

2. **Lead with the problem, not the product.**
   Every piece of content should start with a pain point the audience recognises from their own operations. The product is the resolution, not the opening.

3. **Be direct and specific.**
   Avoid marketing fluff. Instead of "streamline your workflow," say "generate a 7-section audit evidence pack in one click." Instead of "save time," say "replace 40 hours of manual audit preparation with a 2-minute export."

4. **Respect the audience's expertise.**
   SDA providers are professionals managing complex regulatory obligations. Do not explain what NDIS stands for. Do not oversimplify compliance requirements. Speak to them as peers who understand the landscape and need better tools.

5. **Use Australian English throughout.**
   Spell "organise" not "organize." Use "labour" not "labor." Use "colour" not "color" in all public-facing copy (note: code and internal documentation may use US English for consistency with the codebase). Use "per cent" in formal documents, "%" in social media.

**Vocabulary preferences**:

| Use | Avoid |
|---|---|
| Evidence | Data |
| Audit trail | Records |
| Compliance operating system | Management platform |
| Evidence Vault | Document storage |
| Compliance Watchdog | Alert system |
| Built for NDIS providers | Built for everyone |
| Prove compliance | Track compliance |
| The Commission | The regulator |
| Participants | Clients / customers / tenants |
| Providers | Users / customers |

### 4.5 Content Rules -- Do's and Don'ts

**DO**:
- Reference specific NDIS compliance requirements by name (FP1500, APP 3, SDA Design Standard, Practice Standards)
- Use real timeframes from NDIS guidelines (24-hour incident notification, 5-day complaints acknowledgment, 21-day resolution target)
- Include a clear call to action on every piece of content
- Maintain the dark theme (#111827 background) across all social media assets for brand consistency
- Use the teal-600 (#0d9488) accent consistently -- it is the visual anchor of the brand
- Include the brand footer strip (logo + URL) on every social media tile
- Write captions that stand alone without the image -- LinkedIn in particular truncates images on mobile
- Test all text at actual size to ensure readability (minimum 16px for body text on social tiles)
- Use en-dashes (--) not em-dashes or hyphens for parenthetical statements in social copy
- End LinkedIn posts with relevant hashtags (8-12 per post, mix of broad and niche)

**DO NOT**:
- Use light/white backgrounds on social media assets (breaks brand identity)
- Use blue (#3b82f6) as an accent colour -- blue was the previous brand colour and has been replaced by teal
- Use stock photography of people with disabilities without explicit consent and appropriate representation
- Use fear-based messaging without a constructive resolution (every warning must include a solution)
- Claim MySDAManager guarantees NDIS compliance -- no software can guarantee regulatory outcomes
- Use the word "simple" or "easy" to describe compliance (it dismisses the audience's real challenges)
- Post content outside business hours AEST (peak engagement is Tuesday-Thursday, 8:00-10:00 AM AEST)
- Use more than two font weights on a single social media tile (creates visual noise)
- Place text over busy backgrounds or gradients that reduce readability
- Use animated GIFs or flashing elements that may trigger photosensitive reactions (WCAG 2.3.1)
